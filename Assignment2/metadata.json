        "AbstractText": "The amyloid-beta precursor protein is a transmembrane protein expressed in many tissues and highly concentrated in the brain. The protein is of significant interest due to its involvement in the generation of amyloidogenic \u03b2-amyloid peptides, prone to plaque formation that is characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease. The scientific community would benefit from the availability of high-quality anti-amyloid-beta precursor protein antibodies to enhance reproducible research on this target. In this study, we characterized eleven amyloid-beta precursor protein commercial antibodies for Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with a loss of plasticity and cognitive functioning. Previous research has shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) boosts cortical neurotrophic factors, potentially addressing this loss. The current study aimed to expand these findings by measuring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its downstream hippocampal signaling molecules, and behavioral effects of rTMS on the 3xTg-AD mouse line. 3xTg-AD (n = 24) and B6 wild-type controls (n = 26), aged 12 months, were given 14 days of consecutive rTMS at 10 Hz for 10 min. Following treatment, mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests and biochemical analysis of BDNF and its downstream cascades were evaluated via Western blot and ELISA. Results showed that brain stimulation did improve performance on the Object Place Task and increased hippocampal TrkB, ERK, and PLC\u03b3 in 3xTg-AD mice with minimal effects on wild-type mice. There was no significant difference in the levels of AKT and Truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) between treatment and sham. Thus, rTMS has the potential to provide an efficacious non-invasive therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through activation of neurotrophic factor signaling.",

We identified transcriptomic signatures associated with proximity to A\u03b2 in the human inferior temporal cortex (ITC) during late-stage AD, which we further investigated at cellular resolution with combined immunofluorescence and single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). The study provides a data analysis workflow for Visium-SPG, and the data represent a proof-of-principal for the power of multi-omic profiling in identifying changes in molecular dynamics that are spatially-associated with pathology in the human brain.

        "AbstractText": "Delay in diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) syndrome is common, and the lack of familiarity with assessment tools for identifying visual cortical dysfunction is a contributing factor. We propose recommendations for the approach to the evaluation of PCA clinical features during the office visit, the neuropsychological evaluation, and the research setting. A recommended screening battery for eye clinics is also proposed. Recommendations were developed using results from a web-based survey of members of Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Atypical Alzheimer's Disease Professional Interest Area (PIA), literature review, and consensus by the PCA assessment working party of the Atypical Alzheimer's Disease PIA. Survey results revealed robust agreement for assessment tool preferences for PCA features, and many respondents indicated that they reserve assessment tools for use only when PCA is suspected. For some PCA features, curated tools were preferred over validated battery tools, particularly for the office visit. Consensus recommendations superseded survey preferences for two core cognitive features within the 2017 PCA diagnostic criteria. These consensus recommendations provide an evaluation framework for PCA clinical features and can facilitate timely and accurate recognition and diagnosis of PCA. Broader use of these tools should be sought, and development and validation of novel PCA clinical outcome assessments are needed to improve our understanding of atypical AD and other dementias and support the inclusion of those with PCA in treatment trials.",

The objective of this study was to investigate effects of exercise training, dose, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on neurotrophic factors in community-dwelling, older adults with mild-to-moderate AD dementia. This was a pilot blood ancillary study of the FIT-AD trial. Participants in the parent study were randomized to 6-month aerobic exercise (AEx) or stretching control. For this ancillary study, resting plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), irisin, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Estimates of within- and between-group effect sizes were calculated (Cohen's d). Relationships of biomarker change with dose and CRF change were explored with multivariable linear regression and repeated measures correlations. The sample (n = 26, 18 AEx/8 stretching) averaged 77.6 \u00b1 6.9 years old, with the majority being male (65.4%), and non-Hispanic White (92.3%); between-group effect sizes were generally small except for irisin (d = -0.44)), AEx group relative to stretching group.

AD is highly prevalent, with increased projections over the next few decades. Yet current diagnostic methods for AD occur only after the presentation of clinical symptoms. Evidence in the literature points to potential mechanisms of AD induction beginning before clinical symptoms start to present, such as the formation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) extracellular plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Biomarkers of AD, including A\u03b2 40, A\u03b2 42, and tau protein, amongst others, show promise for early AD diagnosis. Additional progress is made in the application of biosensing modalities to measure and detect significant changes in these AD biomarkers within patient samples, such as cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood, serum, or plasma. Herein, a comprehensive review of the emerging nano-biomaterial approaches to develop biosensors for AD biomarkers' detection is provided. Advances, challenges, and potential of electrochemical, optical, and colorimetric biosensors, focusing on nanoparticle-based (metallic, magnetic, quantum dots) and nanostructure-based biomaterials are discussed. Finally, the criteria for incorporating these emerging nano-biomaterials in clinical settings are presented and assessed, as they hold great potential for enhancing early-onset AD diagnostics.",

        "AbstractText": "The human neurovascular system is a complex network of blood vessels and brain cells that is essential to the proper functioning of the brain. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of this system in developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. This process is believed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which the neurovascular system interacts with the brain and how it can be targeted for therapeutic purposes, this area of research holds great promise for the future of neurology and medicine. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials. To overcome the challenges of neurovascular systems and the issues with animal models, we have developed a one-of-a-kind in vitro neurovascular unit-on-a-chip to accurately replicate the in vivo human neurovascular microenvironment. This neuroinflammation-on-a-chip platform has the potential to enhance the current methods of drug development and testing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. By replicating the human neurovascular unit in vitro, a more accurate representation of human physiology can be achieved compared to animal models. The ability to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines in situ and monitor physiological changes, such as barrier function, in real-time can provide an invaluable tool for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs. Moreover, using nano-sized graphene oxide for in situ detection of inflammatory responses is an innovative approach that can advance the field of neuroinflammation research. Overall, our developed neuroinflammation-on-a-chip system has the potential to provide a more efficient and effective method for developing drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",

To identify coding variant associations which may pinpoint effector genes at both novel and previously established genome-wide association loci, we performed meta-analyses of exome-array studies for four glycemic traits: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, up to 144,060 participants), fasting glucose (FG, up to 129,665 participants), fasting insulin (FI, up to 104,140) and 2hr glucose post-oral glucose challenge (2hGlu, up to 57,878). In addition, we performed network and pathway analyses. Single-variant and gene-based association analyses identified coding variant associations at more than 60 genes, which when combined with other datasets may be useful to nominate effector genes. Network and pathway analyses identified pathways related to insulin secretion, zinc transport and fatty acid metabolism. HbA1c associations were strongly enriched in pathways related to blood cell biology. Our results provided novel glycemic trait associations and highlighted pathways implicated in glycemic regulation.

The limitation is a lack of granularity in differentiating MCI patients who convert at different paces. Progression pace prediction has important clinical values, which allow from more personalized interventional strategies, better preparation of patients and their caregivers, and facilitation of patient selection in clinical trials. We proposed a novel ADPacer model which formulated the pace prediction into an ordinal learning problem with a unique capability of leveraging training samples with label ambiguity to augment the training set. This capability differentiates ADPacer from existing ordinal learning algorithms. We applied ADPacer to MCI patient cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), and demonstrated the superior performance of ADPacer compared to existing ordinal learning algorithms. We also integrated the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method with ADPacer to assess the contributions from different modalities to the model prediction.

Given these factors are not consistently shown to play a role in maintaining cognition in Blacks, further examination is needed. Cardiometabolic conditions increase the risk of cognitive issues and are more common in Blacks; thus, examination of biological mechanisms (inflammation, vascular changes, etc.) warrants further study.

The result can be directly used to construct the confidence region of regression parameter. We use the bias correction method to directly calibrate the empirical log-likelihood ratio, which does not need to be multiplied by an adjustment factor.

As a system approaches criticality, it develops \"domain\"-like regions with competing phases and increased spatio-temporal correlations that diverge. The dynamics of these domains depend on the system's proximity to criticality. This study explores the differences in the proximity to criticality of Alzheimer's-afflicted and cognitively normal brains through the use of a spin-lattice model derived from resting-state fMRI data and investigates the type of criticality found in the human brain - whether it is of the Ising class or something more complex. The temporal correlations in both groups display a stretched exponential nature, indicating closer alignment with the criticality of the spin-glass class rather than the Ising class. Longer relaxation times observed in cognitively normal subjects suggest increased proximity to the phase boundary. The weak distinction observed in the spatial characteristics related to proximity to criticality might once more point to a spin-glass scenario, necessitating nuanced order parameters to distinguish between phase-ordering in Alzheimer's and cognitively normal brains.",

Here, we report a case of dementia associated with anti-Rho-GTPase-activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) autoantibodies, which have never been previously linked to DLB. We describe the case of a 78-year-old man who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and a detailed neuropsychological evaluation. The patient presented with mild dementia syndrome associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. Neuropsychological testing revealed impaired cognitive flexibility, figural memory, and verbal memory. Fluctuating cognitive abilities with deficits in attention-executive dysfunction and visuoconstruction also developed over time. A brain MRI showed reduced biparietal and cerebellar brain volume with generalized accentuation of the outer CSF spaces. The patient's CSF revealed anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, which were also detectable in serum. In the differential complementary imaging diagnosis at 2 years, an FDG-PET revealed decreased occupancy of the posterior cingulum and precuneus. Although the FDG-PET, MRI, and clinical findings were potentially consistent with Alzheimer's disease, negative amyloid biomarkers in the CSF made an AD diagnosis highly unlikely. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(123)I] N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-{4-iodophenyl}nortropane ([(123)I]FP-CIT) showed right-sided predominance, reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the putamen, consistent with a positive indicative biomarker finding typical of DLB. Considering the clinically probable DLB associated with the two core features of Parkinsonism and fluctuating cognition with deficits in attention, supported by an abundant tracer uptake in the right putamen and lower uptake in the left putamen on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT as an indicative biomarker, we started an antidementia drug using a cholinesterase inhibitor. Our report shows that atypical DLB may be associated with anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, although their role and significance in the pathogenesis of DLB are unknown. However, it has to be mentioned that it is also possible that antibody-specific synthesis of anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies is a hallmark of a rare autoimmune disease that may cause the clinical and laboratory features involving altered dopamine transporter uptake on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT, dementia, and mild Parkinson's symptoms rather than idiopathic DLB with only two core DLB features and inconsistent cognitive and imaging findings. Further research is needed to investigate the role of these autoantibodies in different dementias, particularly in DLB and mixed DLB-AD types.",

Twenty-one variables related to the education, occupation, social activities, and life habits of 1,093 home-dwelling and cognitively healthy individuals, between 68 and 86 years old, were explored using factorial analyses to delineate several dimensions of CR. These dimensions were contrasted with baseline cognitive performance, follow-up over 5 years of participants' cognitive trajectory, conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and brain volumes using regression and growth curve models, controlling for gender, age, marital status, number of medications, trait anxiety, depression, and ApoE genotype. Five highly intercorrelated dimensions of CR were identified, with some differences in their structure and effects based on gender. Three of them, education/occupation, midlife cognitive activities, and leisure activities, were significantly associated with late-life cognitive performance, accounting for more than 20% of its variance. The education/occupation had positive effect on the rate of cognitive decline during the 5-year follow up in individuals with final diagnosis of MCI but showed a reduced risk for MCI in men. None of these dimensions showed significant relationships with gray or white matter volumes. Proxy markers of CR can be represented by five interrelated dimensions.

During AD clinical trials, APOE-\u03b54 carriers may experience neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs) related to these risks, complicating the differentiation of ARIA from cerebrovascular events based on symptoms. This study aimed to examine the hypothetical impact of considering the APOE-\u03b54 allele's risk for non-ARIA AEs during AD clinical trials. We used data from the Critical Path for Alzheimer's Disease (CPAD) from the placebo arm of randomized controlled trials (RCT) for AD treatment. We determined whether AEs were reported more frequently in APOE-\u03b54 carriers, quantifying with reporting odds ratio (ROR) using a mixed effect model. We also evaluated the association between ROR levels and the prior probability that an AE is symptomatic ARIA. We analyzed 6,313 patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment in 28 trials. Of the prespecified 35 neuropsychiatric or related AEs, several had a significantly high ROR: \"delusion\" (ROR = 4.133), \"confusional state\" (ROR = 1.419), \"muscle spasms\" (ROR = 9.849), \"irritability\" (ROR = 12.62), \"sleep disorder\" (ROR = 2.944), or \"convulsion\" (ROR = 13.00). However, none remained significant after adjusting for Mini-Mental State Examination scores. There is no strong evidence to suggest that specific neuropsychiatric AEs occur more frequently without drug treatment association among APOE-\u03b54 carriers. The influence of APOE-\u03b54 allele[s] on the clinicians' assessment of the likelihood of ARIA during safety monitoring in anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody treatment might be unchanged, thus maintaining the current level of awareness of clinicians of AEs.",

This increase in numbers poses a substantial socioeconomic challenge, emphasizing the need to prioritize dementia within Pakistan's healthcare system. However, the allocation of resources and attention to dementia remains relatively low, leading to considerable difficulties in both diagnosing and treating affected individuals. The provision of comprehensive dementia care faces numerous obstacles, including limited public awareness, insufficient research initiatives, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of specialized training programs. To address these challenges, the Pakistani government must acknowledge and address the stringent regulations governing the neuroscience industry, with a specific emphasis on catering to the unique needs of dementia patients. By doing so, they can ensure the delivery of high-quality care, essential support, and necessary resources for individuals living with dementia in the country.",

        "AbstractText": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have great clinical potential for detecting late-onset diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), allowing the identification of those most at risk years before the symptoms present. Although many studies use various and complicated machine learning algorithms to determine the best discriminatory values for PRSs, few studies look at the commonality of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) utilized in these models. This investigation focussed on identifying SNPs that tag blocks of linkage disequilibrium across the genome, allowing for a generalized PRS model across cohorts and genotyping panels. PRS modeling was conducted on five AD development cohorts, with the best discriminatory models exploring for a commonality of linkage disequilibrium clumps. Clumps that contributed to the discrimination of cases from controls that occurred in multiple cohorts were used to create a generalized model of PRS, which was then tested in the five development cohorts and three further AD cohorts. The model developed provided a discriminability accuracy average of over 70% in multiple AD cohorts and included variants of several well-known AD risk genes. A key element of devising a polygenic risk score that can be used in the clinical setting is one that has consistency in the SNPs that are used to calculate the score; this study demonstrates that using a model based on commonality of association findings rather than meta-analyses may prove useful.",

        "AbstractText": "Rural-dwelling older adults face unique health challenges that may increase risk for Alzheimer's disease and dementia but are underrepresented in aging research. Here, we present an initial characterization of a rural community cohort compared to an urban cohort from the same region. Adults over age 50 living in a non-metropolitan area are clinically characterized using the Uniform Data Set, enriched with additional measures of verbal and non-verbal memory measures. Neighborhood disadvantage is also assessed. Clinical and cognitive differences between cohorts were explored after stratifying by cognitive impairment. Between group comparisons found that rural-dwellers demonstrated better verbal memory than urban-dwellers on primary indices of learning, recall, and recognition, with small to medium effects in overall comparisons. When stratified by impairment, rural-urban differences were notably larger among cognitively normal individuals. Within-group comparisons found that the magnitude of impairment between cognitively normal and impaired groups was greater among rural-dwellers compared to urban-dwellers. No differences in non-verbal memory or overall clinical status were found, and there were no effects of neighborhood disadvantage on any cognitive measure. Living in a rural community presents a complex set of contextual factors that for some, may increase risk for dementia. In this study, we found small to moderate memory advantages for rural-dwellers, leaving open the possibility that late-life rural living may be advantageous for some and promote resilience. Additional prospective research is critically needed to better understand the factors that influence aging outcomes in this underrepresented population.",

        "AbstractText": "Under ideal circumstances, recruitment of older adult-caregiver dyads to dementia research is challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional barriers to recruitment, necessitating swift adjustments to pre-pandemic recruitment strategies and schedules. This brief research report describes the challenges, yield, and cost of recruiting older adult-caregiver dyads to an 18-month observational research study during COVID-19. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel in-home sensor system at identifying cognitive change in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) through background monitoring of activities of daily living (ADL). Recruitment methods included flyers distributed alongside home-delivered meals, direct mailings, publicly available brochures, community presentations, periodical advertisements, and various other strategies. Of 510 inquiries, 117 older adult-caregiver dyads were enrolled at a total cost of ~$368,000, yielding an average per dyad recruiting cost of $3,148. Distributing flyers alongside home-delivered meals produced the most dyads (n = 46, 39%) and the least non-labor costs ($24.33) per enrolled dyad. Recruitment during the pandemic exceeded the pre-COVID-19 budget, but enrollment goals were nevertheless achieved through community-based methods. Our experience illustrates the challenge of recruiting older adult-caregiver dyads to dementia research and the value of trusted community partners in recruiting this population. Our strategies and recommendations may benefit researchers who plan to recruit community-based older adults and their caregivers for future dementia research.",

Sustained engagement in cognitive and physical exercise programs may prevent or delay dementia onset as well as maximize health and function of those with dementia. Despite awareness of the importance of cognitive and physical exercise to brain health, exercise program adherence by older adults is extremely challenging. In this Perspective article, we summarize what is known about contributors to exercise program adherence and strategies to promote it. We discuss our viewpoint on knowledge gaps regarding exercise adherence and research that needs to be conducted. We conclude by proposing a multi-dimensional exercise adherence assessment framework that includes portable neurophysiologic technologies to inform initial design and updating of individualized exercise programs that optimize sustained exercise program engagement and, ultimately, maximize brain health in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment and dementia.",

One mechanism proposed to underlie the beneficial effect of physical exercise (PE) involves the apparent stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). BCI-838 is a pro-drug whose active metabolite BCI-632 is a negative allosteric modulator at group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3). We previously demonstrated that administration of BCI-838 to a mouse model of brain accumulation of oligomeric A\u03b2E22Q (APP E693Q = \"Dutch APP\") reduced learning behavior impairment and anxiety, both of which are associated with the phenotype of Dutch APP mice. 3-month-old mice were administered BCI-838 and/or physical exercise for 1 month and then tested in novel object recognition, neurogenesis, and RNAseq. Here we show that (i) administration of BCI-838 and a combination of BCI-838 and PE enhanced AHN in a 4-month old mouse model of AD amyloid pathology (APP KM670/671NL /PSEN1 \u0394exon9= APP/PS1), (ii) administration of BCI-838 alone or with PE led to stimulation of AHN and improvement in recognition memory, (iii) the hippocampal dentate gyrus transcriptome of APP/PS1 mice following BCI-838 treatment showed up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PIK3C2A of the PI3K-mTOR pathway, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and down-regulation of EIF5A involved in modulation of mTOR activity by ketamine, and (iv) validation by qPCR of an association between increased BDNF levels and BCI-838 treatment.

We hypothesized that the highly bioavailable CurQfen-curcumin (CGM), which has been shown to possess significant blood-brain-barrier permeability and brain bioavailability, would ameliorate dementia in neurodegenerative conditions. In the present double-blinded placebo-controlled 3-arm 3-sequence comparative study, 48 subjects characterized with moderate dementia due to the onset of Alzheimer's disease were randomized into three groups (N = 16/group) and supplemented with 400 mg \u00d7 2/day of either placebo (MCC), unformulated standard curcumin complex with 95% purity (USC), or CGM as a sachet for six months. The relative changes in cognitive and locomotor functions and biochemical markers were compared.

Further, analysis of the serum levels of specific biomarkers (BDNF, A\u03b242, tau protein, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) also revealed a significant (P < 0.05) improvement among CGM subjects as compared to placebo and the USC groups.

Use of both outdoor and indoor space was found to be more individualistic in Boston, in the United States, than in Chieti, Italy, where use of these areas with others was more common. Results suggest that window viewing from within the home may be an activity that individuals in Italy engage in when feeling lonely. Changes in the use of home and community space after COVID-19 were minimal; only in the United States did individuals report greater time indoors since the onset of the pandemic.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress interacts with IAPP aggregates and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM. To examine the role of ER stress in T2DM, we cloned the hIAPP promoter and analyzed its promoter activity in human \u03b2-cells. We found that ER stress significantly enhanced hIAPP promoter activity and expression in human \u03b2-cells via triggering X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing. We identified a binding site of XBP1 in the hIAPP promoter. Disruption of this binding site by substitution or deletion mutagenesis significantly diminished the effects of ER stress on hIAPP promoter activity. Blockade of XBP splicing by MKC3946 treatment inhibited ER stress-induced hIAPP up-regulation and improved human \u03b2-cell survival and function. Our study uncovers a link between ER stress and IAPP at the transcriptional level and may provide novel insights into the role of ER stress in IAPP cytotoxicity and the pathogenesis of T2DM.",

This pilot qualitative study aimed to explore the self-care practices of 12 African Americans providing informal kinship care using a phenomenological approach. Three themes emerged: (a) behaviours to manage stress levels, (b) support network reminding caregivers to take care of themselves and (c) prioritizing my own needs. Specifically, our findings indicate that some caregivers have high-stress levels and engage in maladaptive coping behaviours. The children they cared for reminded them to take care of themselves by attending doctors' appointments or getting their nails done. Nevertheless, some caregivers prioritized their needs by participating in positive self-care behaviours, such as listening to jazz and gospel music and exercising.

Although many A\u03b2 inhibitors are developed, their low A\u03b2-binding affinity results in unsatisfactory effect. To solve this challenge, the A\u03b2 sequence-matching strategy is proposed to tail-design dissociable nanosystem (B6-PNi NPs). Herein, B6-PNi NPs aim to improve A\u03b2-binding affinity for effective dissolution of amyloid fibrils, as well as to interfere with the in vivo fate of amyloid for A\u03b2 clearance. Results show that B6-PNi NPs decompose into small nanostructures and expose A\u03b2-binding sites in response to AD microenvironment, and then capture A\u03b2 via multiple interactions, including covalent linkage formed by nucleophilic substitution reaction. Such high A\u03b2-binding affinity disassembles A\u03b2 fibrils into A\u03b2 monomers, and induces the reassembly of A\u03b2&nanostructure composite, thereby promoting microglial A\u03b2 phogocytosis/clearance via A\u03b2 receptor-mediated endocytosis. After B6-PNi NPs treatment, the A\u03b2 burden, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments are relieved in AD transgenic mice.

Left ventricular (LV) mass, LV ejection fraction, LV concentricity, and peak systolic strain (LV Ecc) were assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume was measured by fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used to measure cognitive functioning.

Although amyloid plaques are the primary characteristic of Alzheimer's disease in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, targeting amyloid-beta clearance in the central nervous system has shown limited clinical efficacy in Alzheimer's disease treatment. Metabolic abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The liver is the primary peripheral organ involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Notably, impaired cholesterol metabolism in the liver may exacerbate the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we explore the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease and elucidate the role of the liver in amyloid-beta clearance and cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, we propose that restoring normal cholesterol metabolism in the liver could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing Alzheimer's disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.",
        "AbstractText": "During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",

        "AbstractText": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The disease is characterized by many Lewy bodies appearing in the patient's cerebrum. DLB frequently presents with a variety of autonomic symptoms from the early or prodromal stages of the disease, and these are listed as supportive features in the diagnostic criteria. As several useful assessment methods for evaluating autonomic function in DLB have been reported, this review will focus on cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction and its assessments. Cardiovascular disorders, such as orthostatic hypotension and abnormal heart rate variability, have been reported in DLB patients. Decreased myocardial uptake by metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy has been added as an indicative biomarker for DLB in the 2017 revision of the diagnostic criteria. We have reported reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia, abnormal respiratory rhythm, and high frequency of sleep-disordered breathing as abnormalities of the respiratory regulatory system associated with DLB. Since autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in DLB from the early or prodromal phase of the disease and is associated with reduced activities of daily living and quality of life, the evaluation of autonomic dysfunction is also useful in the differential diagnosis of DLB from Alzheimer's disease. There are fewer studies on the respiratory regulatory system than on the cardiovascular system, thus further research is needed to explore its role in DLB.",

        "AbstractText": "The glymphatic system plays a key role in the clearance of waste from the parenchyma, and its dysfunction has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, questions remain regarding its complete mechanisms. Here, we report that efflux of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/interstitial fluid (ISF) solutes occurs through a triphasic process that cannot be explained by the current model, but rather hints at the possibility of other, previously undiscovered routes from paravenous spaces to the blood. Using real-time, in vivo observation of efflux, a novel drainage pathway was discovered, in which CSF molecules enter the bloodstream directly through dynamically assembled, trumpet-shaped pores (basolateral \u03d5<8\u00a0\u03bcm; apical \u03d5 < 2\u00a0\u03bcm) on the walls of brain venules. As Zn2+ could facilitate the brain clearance of macromolecular ISF solutes, Zn2+-induced reconstruction of the tight junctions (TJs) in vascular endothelial cells may participate in pore formation. Thus, an updated model for glymphatic clearance of brain metabolites and potential regulation is postulated. In addition, deficient clearance of A\u03b2 through these asymmetric venule pores was observed in AD model mice, supporting the notion that impaired brain drainage function contributes to A\u03b2 accumulation and pathogenic dilation of the perivascular space in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) are designed to connect researchers with clinicians to assess the real-world effectiveness and feasibility of interventions, treatments, or health care delivery strategies in routine practice. Within PCTs larger, more representative sampling is possible to improve the external validity of the research. Older adults from underrepresented groups can benefit from PCTs given their historically lower engagement in clinical research. The current article focuses on older Hispanic adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Older Hispanic adults represent 19% of the US population and have a higher prevalence of ADRDs than Whites. We provide data from 2 PCTs about the recruitment of older Hispanics with ADRDs and discuss unique challenges associated with conducting PCTs and propose strategies to overcome challenges. The first PCT outlined is the Patient Priorities Care for Hispanics with Dementia (PPC-HD) trial. PPC-HD is testing the feasibility of implementing a culturally adapted version of the Patient Priorities Care approach for older Hispanic adults with multiple chronic conditions and dementia. The second PCT is the Dementia Care (D-CARE) Study, which is a multisite pragmatic study comparing the effectiveness of a health care system-based approach and a community-based approach to dementia care to usual care in patients with ADRDs and their family caregivers. The lessons learned are summarized according to the various stakeholders that need to work together to effectively recruit diverse participants for PCTs: individuals, health care systems, research teams, and communities. Individual-level considerations include communication, priorities, and flexibility. Health care system-level considerations are grounded in 4 principles of Community-Based Participatory Research and include collaboration/partnership, available resources, priorities of the health care system, and sustainability. Research team-level considerations include team members, intentionality, and communication. Community-level considerations highlight the importance of partnerships, community members, and appropriate incentives. PCTs provide a unique and potentially impactful opportunity to test interventions in real-world settings that must be culturally appropriate to reach underrepresented groups. Collectively, considering variables at multiple levels to address the needs of older adults with ADRDs is crucial, and the examples and suggestions provided in this report are a foundation for future research.",

        "AbstractText": "Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) exacerbates the risk factor for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (PD) by promoting the alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) pathology in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms of astrocytes involvement in \u03b1-syn pathology underlying the process remain unclear. This study investigated PM with particle size <200 nm (PM0.2) exposure-induced \u03b1-syn pathology in ICR mice and primary astrocytes, then assessed the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (PP242) in vitro studies. We observed the \u03b1-syn pathology in the brains of exposed mice. Meanwhile, PM0.2-exposed mice also exhibited the activation of glial cell and the inhibition of autophagy. In vitro study, PM0.2 (3, 10 and 30 \u00b5g/mL) induced inflammatory response and the disorders of \u03b1-syn degradation in primary astrocytes, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)-mediated autophagy underlies \u03b1-syn pathology. The abnormal function of autophagy-lysosome was specifically manifested as the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3II), cathepsin B (CTSB) and lysosomal abundance increased first and then decreased, which might both be a compensatory mechanism to toxic \u03b1-syn accumulation induced by PM0.2. Moreover, with the transcription factor EB (TFEB) subcellular localization and the increase in LC3II, LAMP2, CTSB, and cathepsin D proteins were identified, leading to the restoration of the degradation of \u03b1-syn after the intervention of PP242. Our results identified that PM0.2 exposure could promote the \u03b1-syn pathological dysregulation in astrocytes, providing mechanistic insights into how PM0.2 increases the risk of developing PD and highlighting TFEB/LAMP2 as a promising therapeutic target for antagonizing PM0.2 toxicity.",

        "AbstractText": "The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clearly correlated to abnormal changes in cortical rhythm. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate how network structure and dynamical characteristics alter their abnormal changes in cortical rhythm. To that end, biological data of AD and normal participates are collected. By extracting the energy characteristics of different sub-bands in EEG signals, we find that the rhythm of AD patients is special particularly in theta and alpha bands. The cortical rhythm of normal state is mainly at alpha band, while that of AD state shift to the theta band. Furthermore, recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to explore the rhythm formation and transformation between two neural states from the perspective view of neurocomputation. It is found that the neural coupling strength decreases significantly under AD state when compared with normal state, which weakens the ability of information transmission in AD state. Besides, the low-dimensional properties of RNN are obtained. By analyzing the relationship between the cortical rhythm transition and the low-dimensional trajectory, it is concluded that the low-dimensional trajectory update is slower and the communication cost is higher in AD state, which explains the abnormal synchronization of AD brain network. Our work reveals the causes for the formation of abnormal brain synchronous functional network status, which may expand our understanding of the mechanism of cognitive impairment in AD and provide an EEG biomarker for early AD.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a serious threat to human health. Researchers and clinicians alike encounter a significant obstacle when trying to accurately identify and classify AD stages. Several studies have shown that multimodal neuroimaging input can assist in providing valuable insights into the structural and functional changes in the brain related to AD. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can accurately categorize AD phases by identifying patterns and linkages in multimodal neuroimaging data using powerful computational methods. This study aims to assess the contribution of ML methods to the accurate classification of the stages of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic search is carried out in IEEE Xplore, Science Direct/Elsevier, ACM DigitalLibrary, and PubMed databases with forward snowballing performed on Google Scholar. The quantitative analysis used 47 studies. The explainable analysis was performed on the classification algorithm and fusion methods used in the selected studies. The pooled sensitivity and specificity, including diagnostic efficiency, were evaluated by conducting a meta-analysis based on a bivariate model with the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of multimodal neuroimaging data and ML methods in the classification of AD stages. Wilcoxon signed-rank test is further used to statistically compare the accuracy scores of the existing models. With a 95% confidence interval of 78.87-87.71%, the combined sensitivity for separating participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77%; for separating participants with AD from NC, it was 94.60% (90.76%, 96.89%); for separating participants with progressive MCI (pMCI) from stable MCI (sMCI), it was 80.41% (74.73%, 85.06%). With a 95% confidence interval (78.87%, 87.71%), the Pooled sensitivity for distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77%, with a 95% confidence interval (90.76%, 96.89%), the Pooled sensitivity for distinguishing AD from NC was 94.60%, likewise (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77% progressive MCI (pMCI) from stable MCI (sMCI) was 80.41% (74.73%, 85.06%), and early MCI (EMCI) from NC was 86.63% (82.43%, 89.95%). Pooled specificity for differentiating MCI from NC was 79.16% (70.97%, 87.71%), AD from NC was 93.49% (91.60%, 94.90%), pMCI from sMCI was 81.44% (76.32%, 85.66%), and EMCI from NC was 85.68% (81.62%, 88.96%). The Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a low P-value across all the classification tasks.

        "AbstractText": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cholinergic system dysfunction, directly affecting the hippocampal neurons. Previous experiments have demonstrated that reduced complexity is one significant effect of AD on electroencephalography (EEG). Motivated by these, this study explores reduced EEG complexity of cholinergic deficiency in AD by neurocomputation. We first construct a new hippocampal CA1 circuit model with cholinergic action. M-current IM and calcium-activated potassium current IAHP are newly introduced in the model to describe cholinergic input from the medial septum. Then, by enhancing IM and IAHP to mimic cholinergic deficiency, how cholinergic deficiency influences the model complexity is investigated by sample entropy (SampEn) and approximate entropy (ApEn). Numerical results show a more severe cholinergic deficit with lower model complexity. Furthermore, we conclude that the decline of SampEn and ApEn is due to the greatly diminished excitability of model neurons. These suggest that decreased neuronal excitability due to cholinergic impairment may contribute to reduced EEG complexity in AD. Subsequently, statistical analysis between simulated AD patients and normal control (NC) groups demonstrates that SampEn and auto-mutual-information (AMI) decrease rates significantly differ. Compared to NC, AD patients have a lower SampEn and a less negative AMI decline rate. These imply a low rate of new-generation information in AD brains with cholinergic deficits. Interestingly, the statistical correlation between SampEn and AMI is analyzed, and they have a large negative Pearson correlation coefficient. Thus, AMI reduction rates may be a complementary tool for complex analysis. Our modeling and complex analysis are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the reduced EEG complexity resulting from cholinergic deficiency.",

The extent to which TGC is associated with these other features and whether it contributes to working memory beyond these features is unknown. Two-hundred-and-three older participants at risk for Alzheimer's dementia-98 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 39 with major depressive disorder (MDD) in remission, and 66 with MCI and MDD (MCI\u2009+\u2009MDD)-completed a clinical assessment, N-back-EEG, and brain MRI. Among them, 190 completed genetic testing, and 121 completed [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C] PIB) PET imaging. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to assess whether TGC is associated with demographic and clinical variables; Alzheimer's disease-related features (APOE \u03b54 carrier status and \u03b2-amyloid load); and structural features related to working memory. Then, linear regressions were used to assess whether TGC is associated with 2-back performance after accounting for these features. Other than age, TGC was not associated with any non-neurophysiological features. In contrast, TGC (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.27; p\u2009=\u20090.006), age (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.29; p\u2009=\u20090.012), and parietal cortical thickness (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.24; p\u2009=\u20090.020) were associated with 2-back performance.

Immediate and early post-traumatic seizures, as well as late post-traumatic epileptic seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy, can have different pathogenetic bases. The following key risk factors associated with post-traumatic epilepsy are known: duration of unconsciousness, gunshot wounds, intracranial hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, prolonged (more than 3 days) post-traumatic amnesia, acute subdural hematoma with surgical evacuation, immediate and early post-traumatic epileptic seizures, fracture of the skull bones. The role of genetic factors in post-traumatic seizures is poorly understood due to the complexity and multiple causal mechanisms. This paper addresses the role of genetic factors in the occurrence and severity of epileptic events in patients with TBI. In particular, we investigated the role of the Cys112Arg single nucleotide polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene. Apolipoprotein E is known for its role in the transport and metabolism of lipids and, therefore, the development of cardiovascular diseases; it is also associated with Alzheimer's disease and has recently been studied in the context of association with epilepsy.

        "ArticleTitle": "Prevalence of Opioid Use in Nursing Homes Over the Last Decade: A Systematic Literature Review.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Despite global concerns of an opioid epidemic, there is no systematic literature review on how frequently these drugs are used in nursing home (NH) populations, including those living with dementia. Objective: This systematic review aims to describe the prevalence and incidence of opioid use in NHs. A secondary objective is to describe the use of these drugs in a subset of NH residents, namely among persons living with dementia. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out using MEDLINE and Scopus (PROSPERO registration number CRD42021254210). Screening of title and abstract was carried out by 2 persons independently for studies published between January 1, 2011 and May 19, 2021. The main outcomes were annual prevalence, period prevalence, and duration of opioid use. Results: From a total of 178 identified studies, 29 were considered eligible for inclusion. The annual prevalence of any opioid use among all NH residents without any selection criteria ranged from 6.3% to 50% with a median annual prevalence of 22.9% (Q25-Q75: 19.5%-30.2%), based on 17 studies. Five studies measured the annual prevalence in NH residents living with dementia, finding that this ranged from 10% to 39.6%. Conclusions: More evidence is needed quantifying opioid use in NH, especially among persons living with dementia. Given that opioid use in NH is still a problem, implementation of a pain management protocol in NH or nationally would help improve clinical outcomes.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Rational design synthesis and evaluation of a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe for selective imaging of amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that remains incurable to date, seriously affecting the quality of life and health of those affected. One of the key neuropathological hallmarks of AD is the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques. Near-infrared (NIR) probes that possess a large Stokes shift show great potential for imaging of A\u03b2 plaques in vivo and in vitro. Herein, we proposed a rational strategy for design and synthesis of a series of NIR fluorescent probes that incorporate a tricarbonitrile group as a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) to enable NIR emission and large Stokes shift for optimal imaging of A\u03b2 plaques. The probe TCM-UM exhibited remarkable in vitro performance, including strong NIR emission (\u03bbem\u00a0=\u00a0670\u00a0nm), large Stokes shift (120-245\u00a0nm), and its affinity for A\u03b242 aggregates (Kd\u00a0=\u00a043.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.09\u00a0nM) was superior to the commercially available probe Thioflavin T (ThT, Kd\u00a0=\u00a0896.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033.43\u00a0nM). Further, TCM-UM was selected for imaging A\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue slices and APP/PS1 transgenic (AD) mice, the results indicated that TCM-UM had an excellent ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared with ThT, and it could effectively distinguish wild-type (Wt) mice and APP/PS1 transgenic (AD) mice.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegeneration is a process leading to the progressive loss of structure and functions of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease have shown many common points at the subcellular level. Neurons are metabolically active cells and need a high amount of energy. Mitochondria are known as the energy synthesis center for cells, involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather than just being an energy synthesis center, it has critical importance for many cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. In the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular functions are disrupted and cells enter the apoptotic or necrotic pathway. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydoxystilbene), a plant-derived polyphenol found in the seed of grapes, berries, peanuts, and wine, has many biological effects such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of free radicals, changes in eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Through the reviewed literature, the current study investigated the protective role of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies show that resveratrol moderates mitochondrial function, redox status, and cellular dynamics in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models of neurodegeneration. Resveratrol suppresses reactive oxygen species production by reducing the activity of complex III due to its competition effect with coenzyme Q. In the present work, we discussed the protective effects of resveratrol on neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative diseases, and the redox biology of the mitochondria.",

        "AbstractText": "Royal jelly is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective bee product. There are several sources for royal jelly and one of them is Indian Royal Jelly (IRJ). However, the neuroprotective actions of IRJ and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are not well known. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of IRJ in the okadaic acid (OKA)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) model in rats. In male Wistar rats, OKA was intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered, and from day 7, they were treated orally with IRJ or memantine for 21 days. Spatial and recognition learning and memory were evaluated from days 27-34; employing the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object recognition tests (NORT), respectively. In vitro biochemical measurements were taken of the cholinergic system and oxidative stress markers. In silico docking was used to find the role of tau protein kinase and phosphatase in the pharmacological action. In OKA-induced rats, IRJ decreased the escape latency and path length in MWM and increased the exploration time for novel objects and the discrimination index in NORT. ICV-OKA rats had higher free radicals and cytokines that caused inflammation and their level of free radical scavengers was back to normal with IRJ treatment. IRJ increased the level of acetylcholine and inhibited acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, the in silico docking study revealed the strong binding affinity of 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), a bioactive constituent of IR, to the tau protein kinases and phosphatases. IRJ may serve as a nootropic agent in the treatment of dementia, and owing to its capacity to prevent oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and increase cholinergic tone; it has the potential to be explored as a novel strategy for the treatment of dementia and AD. More studies may be needed to develop 10-HDA as a novel drug entity for AD.",

A multimodal treatment intervention is the most feasible way to alter the course of AD progression. Hence, the current study was conducted to study the combination of betanin (BET) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) on NLRP3 regulation in aluminum chloride-induced AD in Wistar rats. BET (100,200\u00a0mg/kg) and VCO (1, 5\u00a0g/kg) alone and in combination (BET 100\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0+\u00a0VCO 1\u00a0g/kg and BET 200\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0+\u00a0VCO 5\u00a0g/kg) were given orally for 42 days. On day 21 and 42nd, the behavioral test was performed to check the animal's cognition. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress markers, estimation of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2, and histological examinations were conducted in the hippocampus (H) and cortex (C). Treatment with BET and VCO alone or combined improved behavioral characteristics (MWM and PA p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; EPM p\u00a0=\u00a00.5184), inhibited AChE activity (C, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0101; H, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and lowered oxidative stress in the brain.

While the relation between bilingualism and age of onset has been explored in Alzheimer's dementia, there are few studies examining bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In line with previous findings, we hypothesized that bilinguals with behavioral variant FTD would be older at symptom onset compared to monolinguals, but that no such effect would be found in patients with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) or semantic variant PPA. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant difference in age at symptom onset between monolingual and bilingual speakers within any of the FTD variants, and there were no notable differences on neuropsychological measures.

In this computational modelling study, we test the hypotheses that this metric, and related measures of signal variability and functional connectivity, are sensitive to altered E-I ratios. The E-I ratio in each neural mass of a whole-brain computational network model was systematically varied. We evaluated whether JPEinv, local signal variability (by permutation entropy) and functional connectivity (by weighted symbolic mutual information (wsMI)) were related to E-I ratio, on whole-brain and regional level. The hub disruption index can identify regions primarily affected in terms of functional connectivity strength (or: degree) by the altered E-I ratios. Analyses were performed for a range of coupling strengths, filter and time-delay settings. On whole-brain level, higher E-I ratios were\u00a0associated with higher functional connectivity (by JPEinv and wsMI) and lower local signal variability. These relationships were nonlinear and\u00a0depended on the\u00a0coupling strength, filter and time-delay settings. On regional level, hub-like regions showed a selective decrease in functional degree (by JPEinv and wsMI) upon a lower E-I ratio, and non-hub-like regions showed a selective increase in degree upon a higher E-I ratio. These results suggest that abnormal functional connectivity and signal variability, as previously reported in patients across the AD continuum, can inform us about altered E-I ratios.

        "ArticleTitle": "Spectral analysis and Bi-LSTM deep network-based approach in detection of mild cognitive impairment from electroencephalography signals.",
        "AbstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neuropsychological syndrome that is characterized by cognitive impairments. It typically affects adults 60\u00a0years of age and older. It is a noticeable decline in the cognitive function of the patient, and if left untreated it gets converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD). For that reason, early diagnosis of MCI is important as it slows down the conversion of the disease to AD. Early and accurate diagnosis of MCI requires recognition of the clinical characteristics of the disease, extensive testing, and long-term observations. These observations and tests can be subjective, expensive, incomplete, or inaccurate. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful choice for the diagnosis of diseases with its advantages such as being non-invasive, based on findings, less costly, and getting results in a short time. In this study, a new EEG-based model is developed which can effectively detect MCI patients with higher accuracy. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of EEG signals recorded from a total of 34 subjects, 18 of whom were MCI and 16 control groups was used, and their ages ranged from 40 to 77. To conduct the experiment, the EEG signals were denoised using Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), and to increase the size of the dataset Data Augmentation (DA) method was performed. The tenfold cross-validation method was used to validate the model, moreover, the power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals was extracted from the EEG signals using three spectral analysis methods, the periodogram, welch, and multitaper. The PSD graphs of the EEG signals showed signal differences between the subjects of control and the MCI group, indicating that the signal power of MCI patients is lower compared to control groups. To classify the subjects, one of the best classifiers of deep learning algorithms called the Bi-directional long-short-term-memory (Bi-LSTM) was used, and several machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). These algorithms were trained and tested using the extracted feature vectors from the control and the MCI groups. Additionally, the values of the coefficient matrix of those algorithms were compared and evaluated with the performance evaluation matrix to determine which one performed the best overall. According to the experimental results, the proposed deep learning model of multitaper spectral analysis approach with Bi-LSTM deep learning algorithm attained the highest number of correctly classified samples for diagnosing MCI patients and achieved a remarkable accuracy compared to the other proposed models. The achieved classification results of the deep learning model are reported to be 98.97% accuracy, 98.34% sensitivity, 99.67% specificity, 99.70% precision, 99.02% f1 score, and 97.94% Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).",

We recruited four patients with PCA and a patient with integrative visual agnosia due to bilateral occipitotemporal strokes for comparison. We administered a test battery probing imagery for object shape, size, colour lightness, hue, upper-case letters, lower-case letters, word shape, letter construction, and faces. All subjects showed significant impairments in visual imagery, with imagery for lower-case letters most likely to be spared. We conclude that PCA subjects can show severe deficits in visual imagery.

        "AbstractText": "The irreversible and progressive atrophy by Alzheimer's Disease resulted in continuous decline in thinking and behavioral skills. To date, CNN classifiers were widely applied to assist the early diagnosis of AD and its associated abnormal structures. However, most existing black-box CNN classifiers relied heavily on the limited MRI scans, and used little domain knowledge from the previous clinical findings. In this study, we proposed a framework, named as PINet, to consider the previous domain knowledge as a Privileged Information (PI), and open the black-box in the prediction process. The input domain knowledge guides the neural network to learn representative features and introduced intepretability for further analysis. PINet used a Transformer-like fusion module Privileged Information Fusion (PIF) to iteratively calculate the correlation of the features between image features and PI features, and project the features into a latent space for classification. The Pyramid Feature Visualization (PFV) module served as a verification to highlight the significant features on the input images. PINet was suitable for neuro-imaging tasks and we demonstrated its application in Alzheimer's Disease using structural MRI scans from ADNI dataset. During the experiments, we employed the abnormal brain structures such as the Hippocampus as the PI, trained the model with the data from 1.5T scanners and tested from 3T scanners. The F1-score showed that PINet was more robust in transferring to a new dataset, with approximatedly 2% drop (from 0.9471 to 0.9231), while the baseline CNN methods had a 29% drop (from 0.8679 to 0.6154). The performance of PINet was relied on the selection of the domain knowledge as the PI. Our best model was trained under the guidance of 12 selected ROIs, major in the structures of Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe. In summary, PINet considered the domain knowledge as the PI to train the CNN model, and the selected PI introduced both interpretability and generalization ability to the black box CNN classifiers.",

        "AbstractText": "The Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS) assesses verb and sentence production and comprehension in aphasia. Results from the original English version and from its adaptation to German have shown that the NAVS is able to capture effects of verb-argument structure (VAS) complexity (i.e., lower accuracy for two- and three-argument vs. one-argument verbs) and syntactic complexity (i.e., lower accuracy for non-canonical vs. canonical sentences) in both agrammatic participants and individuals with mild (residual) forms of aphasia. The NAVS has been recently adapted to Italian (NAVS-I) and tested on a group of healthy participants, with results showing longer reaction times to complex vs. simple verbs and sentences. The present study aimed to test the ability of NAVS-I to i) capture verb/sentence production and comprehension deficits in Italian-speaking individuals with agrammatism or with fluent aphasia, and ii) differentiate individuals with aphasia from healthy age-matched participants, with the overall goal to validate its use in clinical practice. Forty-four healthy participants and 28 individuals with aphasia (10 with agrammatic speech production) were administered the NAVS-I, which includes tasks assessing production and comprehension of verbs requiring one, two or three arguments, as well as production and comprehension of canonical and non-canonical sentences. On the Verb Naming Task (VNT), better production of one- (vs. two- and three-) argument verbs was found in the agrammatic group, whereas, verb production in the fluent group was solely predicted by word length and imageability. No effects of argument optionality (i.e., greater difficulty for optionally transitive verbs than for 1-argument verbs) were found. Sentence-level tasks found no differences between the agrammatic and the fluent group in production or comprehension of both canonical and non-canonical sentences; rather, sentence comprehension accuracy was predicted by demographic variables and by aphasia severity. At the individual level, performance on the NAVS-I was significantly different from that of healthy speakers in 26/28 patients. Data show that the NAVS-I is able to capture effects of argument structure complexity in verb production, and effects of syntactic complexity in sentence production and comprehension. In addition, our results point to verb production as the task with greater capability to differentiate agrammatism from other (fluent) forms of aphasia. The study provides support for the use of the NAVS-I in the diagnosis of aphasia, as it is able to detect language deficits at the individual level, even in participants with mild (residual) forms of aphasia.",

        "AbstractText": "The Event Based Model (EBM) is a probabilistic generative model to explore biomarker changes occurring as a disease progresses. Disease progression is hypothesized to occur through a sequence of biomarker dysregulation \"events\". The EBM estimates the biomarker dysregulation event sequence. It computes the data likelihood for a given dysregulation sequence, and subsequently evaluates the posterior distribution on the dysregulation sequence. Since the posterior distribution is intractable, Markov Chain Monte-Carlo is employed to generate samples under the posterior distribution. However, the set of possible sequences increases as N! where N is the number of biomarkers (data dimension) and quickly becomes prohibitively large for effective sampling via MCMC. This work proposes the \"scaled EBM\" (sEBM) to enable event based modeling on large biomarker sets (e.g. high-dimensional data). First, sEBM implicitly selects a subset of biomarkers useful for modeling disease progression and infers the event sequence only for that subset. Second, sEBM clusters biomarkers with similar positions in the event sequence and only orders the \"clusters\", with each successive cluster corresponding to the next stage in disease progression. These two modifications used to construct the sEBM method provably reduces the possible space of event sequences by multiple orders of magnitude. The novel modifications are supported by theory and experiments on synthetic and real clinical data provides validation for sEBM to work in higher dimensional settings. Results on synthetic data with known ground truth shows that sEBM outperforms previous EBM variants as data dimensions increase. sEBM was successfully implemented with up to 300 biomarkers, which is a 6-fold increase over previous EBM applications. A real-world clinical application of sEBM is performed using 119 neuroimaging markers from publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to stratify subjects into 6 stages of disease progression. Subjects included cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). sEBM stage is differentiated for the 3 groups (\u03c72p-value<4.6e-32). Increased sEBM stage is a strong predictor of conversion risk to AD (p-value<2.3e-14) for MCI subjects, as verified with a Cox proportional-hazards model adjusted for age, sex, education and APOE4 status.

Delirium is associated with a significant increase in mortality and the US health care costs associated with delirium are estimated at over $164 billion annually. Despite the prevalence of the condition, the molecular pathophysiology of delirium remains unexplained, limiting the development of pharmacotherapies. Delirious patients can be identified by prominent impairments in attention and working memory (WM), two cognitive domains that localize to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The dlPFC is also a key site for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and given the high risk of delirium in AD patients, suggests that efforts at understanding delirium might focus on the dlPFC as a final common endpoint for cognitive changes. Preclinical studies of the dlPFC reproduce many of the pharmacological observations made of delirious patients, including sensitivity to anticholinergics and an 'inverted U' pattern of dependence on monoaminergic input, with diminished performance outside a narrow range of signaling. Medications like guanfacine, which influence the dlPFC in the context of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have emerged as therapies for delirium and motivate a detailed understanding of the influence of \u03b1-2 agonists on WM. In this review, I will discuss the neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying WM and the function of the dlPFC.

Some studies have tried to improve the 'MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD)' classification by further stratifying these patients into subgroups. Depression-related symptoms may play an important role in helping to better define the MCI stage in elderly individuals. In this work, we explored functional and structural differences in the brains of patients with nondepressed MCI (nDMCI) and patients with MCI with depressive symptoms (DMCI), and we examined how these groups relate to AD atrophy patterns and cognitive functioning. Sixty-five participants underwent MRI exams and were divided into four groups: cognitively normal, nDMCI, DMCI, and AD. We compared the regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, and white matter microstructure measures using diffusion tensor imaging among groups. Additionally, we evaluated changes in functional connectivity using fMRI data. In comparison to the nDMCI group, the DMCI patients had more pronounced atrophy in the hippocampus and amygdala. Additionally, DMCI patients had asymmetric damage in the limbic-frontal white matter connection. Furthermore, two medial posterior regions, the isthmus of cingulate gyrus and especially the lingual gyrus, had high importance in the structural and functional differentiation between the two groups. It is possible to differentiate nDMCI from DMCI patients using MRI techniques, which may contribute to a better characterization of subtypes of the MCI stage.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Neuropathological changes in AD patients occur up to 10-20 years before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Specific diagnosis and appropriate intervention strategies are crucial during the phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The detection of biomarkers has emerged as a promising tool for tracking the efficacy of potential therapies, making an early disease diagnosis, and prejudging treatment prognosis. Specifically, multiple neuroimaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, optical imaging, and single photon emission-computed tomography, have provided a few potential biomarkers for clinical application. The MRI modalities described in this review include structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and arterial spin labelling. These techniques allow the detection of presymptomatic diagnostic biomarkers in the brains of cognitively normal elderly people and might also be used to monitor AD disease progression after the onset of clinical symptoms. This review highlights potential biomarkers, merits, and demerits of different neuroimaging modalities and their clinical value in MCI and AD patients. Further studies are necessary to explore more biomarkers and overcome the limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities for inclusion in diagnostic criteria for\u00a0AD.",

However, the association between APOE4, the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, and GM in AD remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the GM of participants from China and the USA, with and without APOE4 genes and with or without AD (67 AD cases, 67 control cases). Our results revealed that the GM alpha diversity was not different between groups (AD_APOE4, Control_APOE4, AD_non-APOE4, and Control_non-APOE4) (419.031\u00a0\u00b1 143.631 vs 391.091\u00a0\u00b1 126.081, 351.086\u00a0\u00b1 169.174 and 386.089\u00a0\u00b1 177.200, respectively.

Conformation-specific mAbs that target oligomeric and fibrillar A\u03b2 assemblies are of particular interest, as these assemblies are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and progression. This paper reports the generation of rabbit mAbs against two different triangular trimers derived from A\u03b2. These antibodies are the first mAbs generated against A\u03b2 oligomer mimics in which the high-resolution structures of the oligomers are known. We describe the isolation of the mAbs using single B-cell sorting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from immunized rabbits, the selectivity of the mAbs for the triangular trimers, the immunoreactivity of the mAbs with aggregated A\u03b242, and the immunoreactivity of the mAbs in brain tissue from the 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The characterization of these mAbs against structurally defined trimers derived from A\u03b2 enhances understanding of antibody-amyloid recognition and may benefit the development of diagnostics and immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease.",

This article focuses on the methodology and results used to identify the internal lessons learned. PROCare4Life was developed using a codesign approach involving more than 2,000 participants whose input has been listened to and transformed into valuable changes of the system and also into lessons learned included in this case study report. Since the beginning of the implementation of PROCare4Life, there has been a commitment to make invisible knowledge visible through open discussion and including our lessons learned in each of our deliverables. In the last six months of implementation, qualitative research has been implemented by the PROCare4Life consortium to identify and select our most relevant challenges and recommendations for future projects and initiatives. PROCare4Life was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is acknowledged in the lessons learned. However, the consortium has focused on the recommendations that could be more valuable for ordinary implementation of future projects and initiatives developing eHealth tools for elderly citizens living with conditions that might affect their cognitive or mobility capacities. PeRsOnalised Integrated CARE Solution for Elderly (PROCare4Life) was an EU-funded project that ran from January 2020 until June 2023, aiming at improving the quality of life of older people living with Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementia using ICT technologies. The term implementation refers to the process of putting a plan or idea into action. It is a complex process that involves multiple stages, including planning, execution, and evaluation. Implementation research is a growing field of health research that aims to study the factors that affect the implementation of health policies, programs, and practices. It can help identify the best strategies for introducing potential solutions into a health system or promoting their large-scale use and sustainability. For PROCare4Life, when using the term implementation it covers all the stages, including ideation and design phases, although focusing on the pilot 3 iterative codesign and testing of the system. Using daily life devices such as smartphones and smart watches, more than 2,000 people have contributed to co-creating PROCare4Life. The three profiles focused on were older people living with Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementia, their main carers and their healthcare professionals, with an ICT system providing direct communication and allowing them to share their health status. Along the journey to develop PROCare4Life, our European consortium has learned many things that we have internally investigated and reported in this article. We have identified 20 challenges and 41 recommendations. We hope that our lessons learned might be inspiring and valuable for others, particularly future projects and initiatives developing eHealth tools for elderly EU citizens living with different conditions that might affect their cognitive or mobility capabilities.",

An electronic search was accomplished. References of included articles were also manually searched. Studies were critically evaluated for suitability against the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the data was extracted. Bias risk evaluation of the studies and evidence synthesis were conducted. A total of 14 in vivo and 10 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria. PD was induced in 10 in vivo and 7 in vitro studies, while AD was induced in 2 in vivo and 4 in vitro studies. Two studies (1 in vitro and 1 in vivo) evaluated ALS disease and 1 in vivo study evaluated HD. Moderate evidence was found for in vitro studies reporting the positive effect of OCDSCs on PD or AD recovery. Strong evidence was found for in vivo studies in which PD animal models were used; meanwhile, moderate evidence was found for the impact of OCDSCs on AD recovery. Limited evidence was found for in vivo studies evaluating HD and ALS. Although studies reported favorable data regarding the OCDSCs on NDs, they presented a considerable risk of bias. Because of heterogeneous study characteristics, the current study recommends improving standardized methods to evaluate the therapeutic effects of OCDSCs on the NDs.",

However, the specific associations between these pathological changes remain unclear. In this study, we utilized A\u03b242-induced AD rats and primary neural cells as in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro models. The investigations included behavioural tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis, Nissl staining, thioflavin-S staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining, proteomics, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assessment, mitochondrial morphology analysis, electrophysiological studies, Western blotting, and molecular docking. The results revealed changes in synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in the AD models. Remarkably, intervention with Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsules emerged as a pivotal element in this investigation. A\u03b242-induced synaptic dysfunction was significantly mitigated by DZSM intervention, which notably amplified the frequency and amplitude of synaptic transmission. The cognitive impairment observed in AD rats was ameliorated and accompanied by robust protection against structural damage in key brain regions, including the hippocampal CA3, primary cingular cortex, prelimbic system, and dysgranular insular cortex. DZSM intervention led to increased IDE levels, augmented long-term potential (LTP) amplitude, and enhanced dendritic spine density and length. Moreover, DZSM intervention led to favourable changes in mitochondrial parameters, including ROS expression, MMP and ATP contents, and mitochondrial morphology. In conclusion, our findings delved into the realm of altered synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, concurrently highlighting the therapeutic potential of DZSM intervention.",

Between before- and after-diagnosis retinal OCT images, there were significant thickness changes in six of ten (60%) retinal layers across all 48 patients. Through a comparison with age-matched healthy subjects, the significant changes were attributed to AD only (NFL and PR2 layers), age only (GCL, IPL, and RPE layers), or both AD and age (OPL layer). Analyzing ratios of retinal layer thicknesses, 53 of 90 (58.89%) ratios had significant changes. The four independently non-significant layers were assessed to be affected by neither AD nor age (INL layer) or both AD and age (ELM, PR1, and BM layers). The demonstrated image segmentation, measurement, and ratiometric analysis of retinal layers in AD patients may yield a noninvasive OCT image-based retinal biomarker that can be used to detect retinal changes associated with this disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including retroviral-like particles (RVLPs), in pathogenic processes is currently a subject of active investigation. Several studies have identified mechanistic links between the increased presence of EVs and the process of senescence. A recent study reveals that the reverse transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) of a human endogenous retroviral sequence can activate the innate immune system and result in tissue damage and/or the spread of cellular senescence to distant tissues. Several studies have linked EVs to age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and have included isolation of EVs from individuals with these diseases. Loss of epigenetic regulation, immune activation, and environmental stimuli can all lead to the expression of endogenous retroviruses and the incorporation of their proteins and transcripts into EVs. In addition, EVs disseminating these endogenous retroviral components have now been shown to act in a paracrine manner in multiple human diseases. Further investigation of the connection between EVs containing endogenous retroviral protein products or nucleotides should be pursued in models of age-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Most chemicals expressed in mammalian cells have complex delivery and transport mechanisms to get to the right intracellular sites. One of these mechanisms transports most transmembrane proteins, as well as almost all secreted proteins, from the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are formed, to their final location. Nearly all eukaryotic cells have a membrane trafficking mechanism that is both a prominent and critical component. This system, which consists of dynamically coupled compartments, supports the export and uptake of extracellular material, remodeling and signaling at the cellular interface, intracellular alignment, and maintenance of internal compartmentalization (organelles). In animal cells, this system enables both regular cellular activities and specialized tasks, such as neuronal transmission and hormone control. Human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and cancer, are associated with the dysfunction or dysregulation of the membrane trafficking system. Treatment and cure of human diseases depends on understanding the cellular and molecular principles underlying membrane trafficking pathways. A single gene mutation or mutations that result in impaired membrane trafficking cause a range of clinical disorders that are the result of changes in cellular homeostasis. Other eukaryotic organisms with significant economic and agricultural value, such as plants and fungi, also depend on the membrane trafficking system for their survival. In this review, we focused on the major human diseases associated with the process of membrane trafficking, providing a broad overview of membrane trafficking.",

Recently, the synthesis of thiophene-based optical ligands, denoted bi-thiophene-vinyl-benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), that could be utilized for selective assignment of tau pathology in brain tissue with Alzheime's disease (AD) pathology, was reported. Herein, we investigate the ability of these ligands to selectively distinguish tau deposits from aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), the second AD associated pathological hallmark, when replacing the terminal thiophene moiety with other heterocyclic motifs. The selectivity for tau pathology was reduced when introducing specific heterocyclic motifs, verifying that specific molecular interactions between the ligands and the aggregates are necessary for selective detection of tau deposits. In addition, ligands having certain heterocyclic moieties attached to the central thiophene-vinylene building block displayed selectivity to aggregated A\u03b2 pathology.

AD is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Recent research on AD has made significant strides, including the development of an \"amyloid clock\" biomarker that tracks AD progression through positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Surf4 and other genes have been discovered to play a role in regulating beta-amyloid toxicity, while inhibiting the enzyme hexokinase-2 has shown positive results in preclinical studies. New brain mapping techniques have identified early brain-based causes of cognitive changes in AD, and biomarkers such as neuronal pentraxin protein Nptx2 and astrocytic 7-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChRs) show potential for early detection. Other approaches, such as replenishing the enzyme Tip60, selectively degrading the modified protein p-p38 with PRZ-18002, and targeting the protein voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and preventing pathophysiological alterations linked to AD. Baseline blood samples and other biomarkers such as urine formic acid, p-tau 198, microRNAs, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have also been discovered for early detection and intervention of AD. Additionally, recent FDA approvals for medications such as aducanumab and lecanemab provide options for reducing AD symptoms and improving function, while clinical trials for dementia vaccines show promise for the nasal and beta-amyloid 40 vaccines as well as vaccinations targeting tau. These advancements in AD research, including biomarker discovery and the development of disease-modifying treatments, are crucial steps towards improving the lives of those affected by AD and finding a cure for this debilitating disease.",

Specifically, LOSHAK will investigate the social, economic, environmental, biological, and policy processes that shape late-life health and economic well-being in Kenya. Modeled on the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), LOSHAK joins a network of harmonized studies on aging in >45 countries worldwide; however, LOSHAK will be only the 2nd such study in SSA. The current feasibility and pilot phase of LOSHAK will validate measures and data collection procedures in a purposive sample of Kenyan adults aged \u226545 years. We have linguistically and culturally translated instruments while aiming to maintain harmonization with both existing HRS network studies and the ongoing Kenya Life Panel Survey. The current phase of LOSHAK is nested within the Kaloleni/Rabai Community Health and Demographic Surveillance System on the coast of Kenya. LOSHAK will advance population aging research in low- and middle-income countries through the study of (a) biomarkers and physiological measures; (b) the impacts of air pollution and climate vulnerability; (c) Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, mental health, disability, caregiving, and psychosocial wellbeing; and (d) economic security, including the impact of social welfare.

There is considerable ongoing debate concerning the relative advantages and disadvantages of surgical treatment (internal fixation or arthroplasty) vs nonoperative treatment for femoral neck fractures in older persons with AD. This retrospective cohort study compared the mortality, hazard ratio, and survival rate between operative and nonoperative treatments, controlling for patients' demographic information and baseline health status. The study population consisted of Optum beneficiaries diagnosed with AD who experienced an initial femoral neck fracture claim between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were applied to compare the treatment groups' post-fracture survival rates and mortality. Cox regression was used to examine the survival period by controlling the covariates. Out of the 4157 patients with AD with femoral neck fractures, 59.8% were women (n\u2009=\u20092487). The median age was 81\u2009years. The 1-year survival rate for nonoperative treatment (70.19%) was lower than that for internal fixation (75.27%) and arthroplasty treatment (82.32%). Compared with the nonoperative group, arthroplasty surgical treatment had significant lower hazard risk of death (arthroplasty hazard ratio: 0.850, 95% CI: 0.728-0.991, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The findings suggest that the operative treatment group experiences higher survival rates and lower mortality rates than the nonoperative group.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. Early symptoms include the loss of memory and mild cognitive ability; however, as the disease progresses, these symptoms can present with increased severity manifesting as mood and behaviour changes, disorientation, and a loss of motor/body control. AD is one of the leading causes of death in the UK, and with an ever-increasing ageing society, patient numbers are predicted to rise posing a significant global health emergency. AD is a complex neurophysiological disorder where pathology is characterized by the deposition and aggregation of misfolded amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-protein that in-turn promotes excessive tau-protein production which together drives neuronal cell dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. It is widely accepted that AD is driven by a combination of both genetic and immunological processes with recent data suggesting that adaptive immune cell activity within the parenchyma occurs throughout disease. The mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear but suggest that manipulating the adaptive immune response during AD may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Using immunotherapy for AD treatment is not a new concept as the only two approved treatments for AD use antibody-based approaches to target A\u03b2. However, these have been shown to only temporarily ease symptoms or slow progression highlighting the urgent need for newer treatments. This review discusses the role of the adaptive immune system during AD, how microbial infections may be contributing to inflammatory immune activity and suggests how adaptive immune processes can pose as therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The topological connectivity information derived from the brain functional network can bring new insights for diagnosing and analyzing dementia disorders. The brain functional network is suitable to bridge the correlation between abnormal connectivities and dementia disorders. However, it is challenging to access considerable amounts of brain functional network data, which hinders the widespread application of data-driven models in dementia diagnosis. In this study, a novel distribution-regularized adversarial graph auto-Encoder (DAGAE) with transformer is proposed to generate new fake brain functional networks to augment the brain functional network dataset, improving the dementia diagnosis accuracy of data-driven models. Specifically, the label distribution is estimated to regularize the latent space learned by the graph encoder, which can make the learning process stable and the learned representation robust. Also, the transformer generator is devised to map the node representations into node-to-node connections by exploring the long-term dependence of highly-correlated distant brain regions. The typical topological properties and discriminative features can be preserved entirely. Furthermore, the generated brain functional networks improve the prediction performance using different classifiers, which can be applied to analyze other cognitive diseases. Attempts on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed model can generate good brain functional networks. The classification results show adding generated data can achieve the best accuracy value of 85.33%, sensitivity value of 84.00%, specificity value of 86.67%. The proposed model also achieves superior performance compared with other related augmented models. Overall, the proposed model effectively improves cognitive disease diagnosis by generating diverse brain functional networks.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a terrible and degenerative disease commonly occurring in the elderly. Early detection can prevent patients from further damage, which is crucial in treating AD. Over the past few decades, it has been demonstrated that neuroimaging can be a critical diagnostic tool for AD, and the feature fusion of different neuroimaging modalities can enhance diagnostic performance. Most previous studies in multimodal feature fusion have only concatenated the high-level features extracted by neural networks from various neuroimaging images simply. However, a major problem of these studies is over-looking the low-level feature interactions between modalities in the feature extraction stage, resulting in suboptimal performance in AD diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a dual-branch vision transformer with cross-attention and graph pooling, namely CsAGP, which enables multi-level feature interactions between the inputs to learn a shared feature representation. Specifically, we first construct a brand-new cross-attention fusion module (CAFM), which processes MRI and PET images by two independent branches of differing computational complexity. These features are fused merely by the cross-attention mechanism to enhance each other. After that, a concise graph pooling algorithm-based Reshape-Pooling-Reshape (RPR) framework is developed for token selection to reduce token redundancy in the proposed model. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the suggested method obtains 99.04%, 97.43%, 98.57%, and 98.72% accuracy for the classification of AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, CN vs. MCI, and AD vs. CN vs. MCI, respectively.",

Recent studies have shown how hypertension is related to cognitive decline in elderly patients, which in turn leads to increased mortality as well as morbidity. There have been various studies that have looked at the effect of antihypertensive drugs in reducing cognitive decline, and their results have proved inconclusive. However, most of these studies assume the treatment effect is similar for all patients, thus considering only the average treatment effects of antihypertensive drugs. In this paper, we assume that the effect of antihypertensives on the onset of AD depends on patient characteristics. We develop a deep learning method called LASSO-Dragonnet to estimate the individualized treatment effects of each patient. We considered six antihypertensive drugs, and each of the six models considered one of the drugs as the treatment and the remaining as control. Our studies showed that although many antihypertensives have a positive impact in delaying AD onset on average, the impact varies from individual to individual, depending on their various characteristics. We also analyzed the importance of various covariates in such an estimation. Our results showed that the individualized treatment effects of each patient could be estimated accurately using a deep learning method, and that the importance of various covariates could be determined.",

The mechanism by which A\u03b2 triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A\u03b2 self-associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A\u03b2 can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A\u03b2 ion-channel pore formation.

Happiness was associated with worse reasoning. No association was found between happiness and the rate of change over time on any of the cognitive tasks.

        "AbstractText": "Cortical thickness is an important biomarker associated with gray matter atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. In order to conduct meaningful comparisons of cortical thickness between different subjects, it is imperative to establish correspondence among surface meshes. Conventional methods achieve this by projecting surface onto canonical domains such as the unit sphere or averaging feature values in anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). However, due to the natural variability in cortical topography, perfect anatomically meaningful one-to-one mapping can be hardly achieved and the practice of averaging leads to the loss of detailed information. For example, two subjects may have different number of gyral structures in the same region, and thus mapping can result in gyral/sulcal mismatch which introduces noise and averaging in detailed local information loss. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new method that can overcome these intrinsic problems to construct more meaningful comparison for atrophy detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel personalized patch-based method to improve cortical thickness comparison across subjects. Our model segments the brain surface into patches based on gyral and sulcal structures to reduce mismatches in mapping method while still preserving detailed topological information which is potentially discarded in averaging. Moreover,the personalized templates for each patch account for the variability of folding patterns, as not all subjects are comparable. Finally, through normality assessment experiments, we demonstrate that our model performs better than standard spherical registration in detecting atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

Magnesium-L-threonate has recently been found to have protective effects on learning and memory in aged and Alzheimer's disease model mice. However, the effects of magnesium-L-threonate on the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. Previously, we reported that magnesium-L-threonate treatment improved cognition and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in a double-transgenic line of Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1). Here, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze changes in the microbiome and serum metabolome following magnesium-L-threonate exposure in a similar mouse model. Magnesium-L-threonate modulated the abundance of three genera in the gut microbiota, decreasing Allobaculum and increasing Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter. We also found that differential metabolites in the magnesium-L-threonate-regulated serum were enriched in various pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The western blotting detection on intestinal tight junction proteins (zona occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) showed that magnesium-L-threonate repaired the intestinal barrier dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that magnesium-L-threonate may reduce the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease through the microbiota-gut-brain axis in model mice, providing an experimental basis for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) scales are composite scores calculated as the sum of the component test scores weighted by the reciprocal of their standard deviations at the baseline visit. Reciprocal standard deviation is an arbitrary weighting in this context, and may be an inefficient utilization of the data contained in the component measures. Mathematically derived optimal composite weighting is a promising alternative. Sample size projections using standard power calculation formulas were used to describe the relative performance of component measures and their composites when used as endpoints for clinical trials. Power calculations were informed by (n=1,333) amnestic mild cognitive impaired participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set. A composite constructed using PACC reciprocal standard deviation weighting was both less sensitive to change than one of its component measures and less sensitive to change than its optimally weighted counterpart. In standard sample size calculations informed by NACC data, a clinical trial using the PACC weighting would require 38% more subjects than a composite calculated using optimal weighting. These findings illustrate how reciprocal standard deviation weighting can result in inefficient cognitive composites, and underscore the importance of component weights to the performance of composite scales. In the future, optimal weighting parameters informed by accumulating clinical trial data may improve the efficiency of clinical trials in AD.",

With limited therapeutic options, clinical trials have been investigating Alzheimer's disease treatment using more novel approaches, including gene therapy. However, there is limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of such treatments. Objectives: This research aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical gene therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease at varying degrees of severity. Methods: A Markov model with a 20-year time horizon was constructed for simulated cohorts with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, assigned to receive either standard of care or a one-time gene therapy administration. Varying costs of care due to disease severity and treatment efficacy were utilized to determine the effect of those variables at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. Results: Under the initial assumption that the hypothetical gene therapy grants a 30% risk reduction in disease progression and entry into institutional care, the maximum cost-effective price for gene therapy is $141,126 per treatment using the threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). By increasing the treatment effectiveness to 50%, cost-effective price nearly doubled at each willingness-to-pay threshold (e.g.,\u00a0$260,902 at the $150,000/QALY threshold). Conclusion: Despite being cost-effective at a very high price, the hypothetical gene therapy for AD would still need to be priced considerably lower than other approved gene therapies on the market. Thus, a comprehensive pharmacoeconomic assessment remains critical in pricing innovative therapy and determining coverage for patients in need.",

A history of stroke, arterial stiffness, and obesity were associated with an increased risk of developing brain aging during the five years of follow-up. Lifestyle, vascular, metabolic and inflammatory factors were associated with brain aging in older adults, which adds to the evidence of shared pathways for sensorineural and neurocognitive declines in aging. Targeting these shared central processing etiological factors with interventions may lead to retention of better neurological function, benefiting multiple systems, i.e., hearing, smell, and cognition, ultimately helping older adults retain independence and higher quality of life longer.",

        "AbstractText": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been associated with an increased risk of dementia; yet the evidence is mixed. This review critically appraises and synthesises current evidence exploring associations between dementia risk and CVD and their risk factors, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and arterial stiffness. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between at least one of the CVDs of interest and dementia risk. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews was used to assess methodological quality. Twenty-five meta-analyses published between 2007 and 2021 were included. Studies largely consisted of cohorts from North America and Europe. Findings were variable, with coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation consistently associated with increased risk for all-cause dementia, but results were inconsistent for Alzheimer's disease. Hypertension was more frequently associated with dementia during mid-life compared to late life. Findings concerning cholesterol were complex, and while results were inconsistent for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol, there appeared to be no associations between triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. All meta-analyses investigating hypercholesterolaemia showed significant increases in dementia risk. There was a paucity of research on the association between arterial stiffness and dementia risk. Targeted CVD dementia prevention strategies could reduce dementia prevalence. Future research should determine the underpinning mechanisms linking heart and brain health to determine the most effective strategies for dementia risk reduction in CVD populations.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Differential effects of chronotype on physical activity and cognitive performance in older adults.",
        "AbstractText": "Chronotypes reflect individuals' preferred activity and sleep patterns (e.g., \"morning-types\" vs. \"evening-types\") and are associated with health and physical activity. Less is known about the relationship between chronotype and cognitive health in older adults. It is unclear whether chronotype's influence is driven by sleep timing or disruption. This study explored the relationship between chronotype, physical activity, and cognitive performance in older adults with and without self-reported sleep disorders. Participants were 153 older adults (M\u2009=\u200970.35, SD\u2009=\u20095.89) who wore an Actigraph on the non-dominant wrist for seven days to measure total physical activity, peak physical activity, and chronotype (sleep interval midpoint). We categorized participants as morning-, evening-, and intermediate-chronotypes and assessed cognitive performance in domains of attention, executive function, and verbal memory. MANCOVAs showed patterns of activity across the 24-hour day differed between chronotypes such that morning-types were active earlier and evening-types active later, ps\u2009>\u2009.001. Total physical activity and average peak activity did not differ between chronotypes, (ps\u2009\u2265\u2009.117). Timing of peak activity followed expectations (morning-types peaked earliest (p\u2009=\u2009.019). Evening-types exhibited significantly worse executive function and attention than intermediate-types, p\u2009=\u2009.008. When excluding participants with sleep disorders, evening-types engaged in significantly less total physical activity than other groups, but cognitive performance did not differ. We found no differences in total or peak physical activity between groups, which is inconsistent with findings from studies in younger samples. This suggests the role of chronotype on physical activity may change with age and points to the potential impact of methodological discrepancies. While evening-types exhibited worse executive function and attention performance, this finding disappeared when participants with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep dysregulation rather than sleep timing may be driving this difference. Recent trends in physical activity research explore activity patterns across the 24-hour day and acknowledge codependence between different activity types. Our findings suggest chronotype and activity timing may be important as researchers advance this line of research in older adults.",

        "AbstractText": "This study presents the first findings regarding extraction, isolation, enzyme inhibition, and antioxidant activity. The oral mucosal wound-healing process was investigated using propolis water extract (PWE) incubation with gingival fibroblast cells and concluded that propolis was effective on the oral mucosal wound-healing pattern compared to untreated controls. Additionally, phenolic compounds (fraxetin, apigenin, galangin, pinobanksin, chrysin, etc.) were isolated from propolis, and their chemical structures were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer potential activities of PWE and some isolated compounds were screened and revealing their inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with IC50 values ranging from 0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 to 1.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009mM, as well as remarkable free-radical scavenging and metal reduction capacities. The results suggest that these compounds and PWE can be used as therapeutic agents due to their antioxidant properties and inhibitory potential on AChE. It can also be used for therapeutic purposes since its wound-healing effect is promising.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) induces neurotoxicity, which is the primary risk factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- (BACE) and \u03b3- (PS1, PS2) secretases is a critical step in the amyloidogenic pathway. The induction of neuronal apoptosis by A\u03b2 involves increased expression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X (Bax) and decreased Bcl-2 expression. The seed of Carthamus tinctorius L. (CTS) and the aerial part of Taraxacum coreanum (TC) are traditional herbs used to treat several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of co-treatment with CTS and TC on A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. CTS, TC, and the co-treatment (CTS\u2009+\u2009TC) were added to A\u03b225-35-treated SH-SY5Y cells. CTS\u2009+\u2009TC synergistically increased cell viability and inhibited reactive oxygen species production. CTS\u2009+\u2009TC resulted in significant downregulation of BACE, PS1, PS2, and APP, as well as the 99-aa C-terminal domain of APP, compared with either CTS or TC alone. Compared with the single herbs, co-treatment with CTS and TC markedly decreased the expression of Bax and increased the expression of Bcl-2, consistent with its anti-apoptotic effects. These findings suggest that co-treatment with CTS and TC may be useful for AD prevention.",

        "AbstractText": "Disturbances in the local and peripheral immune systems are closely linked to a wide range of diseases. In the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), inflammation plays a crucial role, often appearing as a common manifestation despite the variability in the occurrence of other pathophysiological hallmarks. Thus, combating neuroinflammation holds promise in treating complex pathophysiological diseases like AD. Growing evidence suggests the gut microbiome's crucial role in shaping the pathogenesis of AD by influencing inflammatory mediators. Gut dysbiosis can potentially activate neuroinflammatory pathways through bidirectional signaling of the gut-brain axis; however, the precise mechanisms of this complex interweaved network remain largely unclear. In these milieus, this review attempts to summarize the contributing role of gut microbiome-mediated neuroinflammatory signals in AD pathophysiology, while also pondering potential mechanisms through which commensal and pathogenic gut microbes affect neuroinflammation. While certain taxa such as Roseburia and Escherichia have been strongly correlated with AD, other clades such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium exhibit variations at the species and strain levels. In order to disentangle the inflammatory aspects of neurodegeneration attributed to the gut microbiome, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies investigate the species/strain-level dependency of commensals, opportunistic, and pathogenic gut microbes that consistently show correlations with AD patients across multiple associative studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are increasingly used to forecast progression trajectories of cognitive decline caused by preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many existing studies have explored the potential of these two distinct modalities with diverse machine and deep learning approaches. But successfully fusing MRI and PET can be complex due to their unique characteristics and missing modalities. To this end, we develop a hybrid multimodality fusion (HMF) framework with cross-domain knowledge transfer for joint MRI and PET representation learning, feature fusion, and cognitive decline progression forecasting. Our HMF consists of three modules: 1) a module to impute missing PET images, 2) a module to extract multimodality features from MRI and PET images, and 3) a module to fuse the extracted multimodality features. To address the issue of small sample sizes, we employ a cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy from the ADNI dataset, which includes 795 subjects, to independent small-scale AD-related cohorts, in order to leverage the rich knowledge present within the ADNI. The proposed HMF is extensively evaluated in three AD-related studies with 272 subjects across multiple disease stages, such as subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches in forecasting progression trajectories of AD-related cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "While linguistic retrogenesis has been extensively investigated in the neuroscientific and behavioral literature, there has been little work on retrogenesis using computerized approaches to language analysis. We bridge this gap by introducing a method based on comparing output of a pre-trained neural language model (NLM) with an artificially degraded version of itself to examine the transcripts of speech produced by seniors with and without dementia and healthy children during spontaneous language tasks. We compare a range of linguistic characteristics including language model perplexity, syntactic complexity, lexical frequency and part-of-speech use across these groups. Our results indicate that healthy seniors and children older than 8 years share similar linguistic characteristics, as do dementia patients and children who are younger than 8 years. Our study aligns with the growing evidence that language deterioration in dementia mirrors language acquisition in development using computational linguistic methods based on NLMs. This insight underscores the importance of further research to refine its application in guiding developmentally appropriate patient care, particularly in early stages.",

        "AbstractText": "Delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning (DEACMP) is the most severe complication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which seriously endangers patients' quality of life. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) on improving dementia symptoms in patients with DEACMP. A retrospective analysis was performed on DEACMP patients, who visited Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from June 2014 to June 2020. Among them, patients who received conventional drug treatment combined with HBO2 treatment were included in an HBO2 group, while those who only received conventional drug treatment were included in a control group. HBO2 was administered once daily. Patients in the HBO2 group received 6 courses of treatment, with each course consisting of 10 sessions. The Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS) was used to diagnose dementia, and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was used to grade the severity of dementia for DEACMP. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-Cog), the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus) were performed to assess cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), behavioral and psychological symptoms, and overall function. The study further analyzed the results of objective examinations related to patients' dementia symptoms, including magnetic resonance imaging detection of white matter lesions and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). The changes of the above indicators before and after treatment, as well as the differences between the 2 groups after treatment were compared. There was no significant difference in the HDS score and CDR grading between the 2 groups before treatment (both P>0.05). After treatment, the score of ADAS-Cog, FAQ, NPI, and CIBIC Plus grading of the 2 groups were significantly improved, and the improvement of the above indicators in the HBO2 group was greater than that in the control group (all P<0.05). The effective rate of the HBO2 group in treating DEACMP was significantly higher than that of the control group (89.47% vs 65.87%, P<0.05). The objective examination results (white matter lesions and abnormal EEG) showed that the recovery of patients in the HBO2 group was better than that in the control group.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Recent findings suggest that the plasma axonal structural protein, neurofilament light (NFL) chain, may serve as a potential blood biomarker for early signs of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the need for early detection of neurodegenerative disorders, the current study investigated the associations between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in brain regions associated with neurodegenerative disorders and memory function with plasma NFL in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: We recruited 29 AD, 76 MCI, and 39 HCs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in the current cross-sectional study. We used Pearson's correlation models adjusted for the effect of age, sex, and APOE genotype to investigate the association between plasma NFL and rCBF. Results: We found non-significant differences in age (F(2, 141) = 1.304; P = 0.275) and years of education (F(2, 141) = 0.013; P = 0.987). Additionally, we found significant differences between groups in terms of MMSE scores (F(2, 141) = 100.953; P < 0.001). Despite the observation of significantly reduced rCBF in AD and MCI groups versus HCs, we did not detect significant differences in plasma NFL between these groups. We found significant negative associations between plasma NFL and rCBF in various AD-related regions, these findings were only observed after analyses in all participants, and were observed in HCs alone and no significant associations were observed in the AD or MCI groups. Conclusion: These outcomes add to our current understanding surrounding the use of rCBF and plasma NFL biomarkers as tools for early detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. A conclusion might be that the association between NFL and impaired rCBF exists before the clinical symptoms appear. Further longitudinal studies with a large sample size should be performed to examine the correlation between plasma NFL and rCBF in order to understand these complex relationships.",

A total of 1,013 patients were recruited, in which 87 patients with MCI finished a two-year follow-up. To establish a prediction model, 61 patients were randomly divided into a training set and 26 patients were divided into a testing set. A total of 121 features including demographic characteristics, hematological indicators, and intestinal flora abundance were analyzed. Of the 87 patients who finished a two-year follow-up, 44 presented rapid progression. Model 1 was established based on 121 features with the accuracy 85%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 83%. Model 2 was based on the first fifteen features of model 1 (triglyceride, uric acid, alanine transaminase, F-Clostridiaceae, G-Megamonas, S-Megamonas, G-Shigella, G-Shigella, S-Shigella, average hemoglobin concentration, G-Alistipes, S-Collinsella, median cell count, average hemoglobin volume, low-density lipoprotein), with the accuracy 97%, sensitivity 92%, and specificity 100%. Model 3 was based on the first ten features of model 1, with the accuracy 97%, sensitivity 86%, and specificity 100%.

        "AbstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a high-risk dementia condition which progresses to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) at approximately 10% to 15% per year. Characterization of group-level differences between two subtypes of MCI - stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) is the key step to understand the mechanisms of MCI progression and enable possible delay of transition from MCI to AD. Functional connectivity (FC) is considered as a promising way to study MCI progression since which may show alterations even in preclinical stages and provide substrates for AD progression. However, the representative FC patterns during AD development for different clinical groups, especially for sMCI and pMCI, have been understudied. In this work, we integrated autoencoder and multi-class classification into a single deep model and successfully learned a set of clinical group related feature vectors. Specifically, we trained two non-linear mappings which realized the mutual transformations between the original FC space and the feature space. By mapping the learned clinical group related feature vectors to the original FC space, representative FCs were constructed for each group. Moreover, based on these feature vectors, our model achieves a high classification accuracy - 68% for multi-class classification (NC vs SMC vs sMCI vs pMCI vs AD). Code has been released.",

Over the course of AD research, A\u03b2 has consistently been at the forefront of scientific inquiry and discussion. In this review, we epitomize the role of a potential structural motif (GxxxG motif) that may provide a new horizon to the A\u03b2 conflict.

Oral microorganisms take part in human diseases, including Oral cavity inflammation, mucosal disease, periodontal disease, tooth decay, and oral cancer. On the other hand, oral microbes can also cause endocrine disorders, digestive function, and nerve function disorders, such as diabetes, digestive system diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. It was noted that the proteins of oral microbes play significant roles in these serious diseases. Having a good knowledge of oral microbes can be helpful in analyzing the procession of related diseases. Moreover, the high-dimensional features and imbalanced data lead to the complexity of oral microbial issues, which can hardly be solved with traditional experimental methods. To deal with these challenges, we proposed a novel method, which is oral_voting_transfer, to deal with such classification issues in the field of oral microorganisms. Such a method employed three features to classify the five oral microorganisms, including Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, abiotrophy adjacent, bifidobacterial, and Capnocytophaga. Firstly, we utilized the highly effective model, which successfully classifies the organelle's proteins and transfers to deal with the oral microorganisms. And then, some classification methods can be treated as the local classifiers in this work. Finally, the results are voting from the transfer classifiers and the voting ones. The proposed method achieved the well performances in the five oral microorganisms.

The tau PET tracer 18F-MK-6240 has shown favorable imaging characteristics to identify early tau deposition in aging. We evaluated the relationship between in vivo tau levels (18F-MK-6240) and retrospective cognitive change over 5 years in episodic memory, processing speed, and reasoning. For tau quantification, a set of regions of interest (ROIs) was selected a priori based on previous literature: (1) total-ROI comprising selected areas, (2) medial temporal lobe-ROI, and (3) lateral temporal lobe-ROI and cingulate/parietal lobe-ROI. Higher tau burden in most ROIs was associated with a steeper decline in memory and speed. There were no associations between tau and reasoning change. The novelty of this finding is that tau burden may affect not only episodic memory, a well-established finding but also processing speed. Our finding reinforces the notion that early tau deposition in areas related to Alzheimer's disease is associated with cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals, even in a sample with low amyloid-\u03b2 pathology.",

Cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications, but the underlying mechanisms are still undetermined. The autonomic imbalance is a major cause for CVS morbidity in T2DM which could also potentially affect cognition. But there is sparse data available in the literature to prove the association between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. We recruited 40 T2DM patients and 40 healthy controls. The assessment of cognitive functions was done by cognitive P300 event-related potential (ERP) and MoCA. Heart rate variability (HRV) was done to assess autonomic function. The P300 ERP latency in Fz, Cz and Pz sites was significantly prolonged in T2DM patients (P < 0.001). We found moderate correlation is present between P300 latency and total power (r = -0.466, P < 0.01) and LFnu (r = -0.423, P < 0.01) in T2DM patients. The total power and HbA1C show independent association with P300 latency after adjustment for confounding factors like age and duration of diabetes (P < 0.05). As the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is rising among T2DM patients increasing their dependency, making necessary lifestyle measures at earliest to improve autonomic balance may prevent or delay the onset of cognitive decline and alleviate its consequences and improve the quality of life in T2DM patients.",

In this study, the majority of caregivers were males (62%), with a median, monthly household income of Rs. 24,000, and expenditure of Rs. 12,000. The median cost of medicine was Rs. 1000 per month. The majority (64%) of patients did not have any health insurance. A total of 28 (56%) caregivers reported the cost of damage due to illness behavior. It was found that the severity of illness and current level of functioning had a significant negative correlation with caregivers' burden. The financial well-being as reflected through income and health expenditure did not have a significant correlation with the caregivers' burden. Caregivers of persons with BPAD meet the treatment expenditure out of their pocket. Though they have the financial burden, it is the illness severity and functioning capacities that are associated with caregivers' burden. These findings have implications for mental health care in persons with BPAD.",

        "AbstractText": "Although diverse language deficits have been widely observed in prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying nature of such deficits and their explanation remains opaque. Consequently, both clinical applications and brain-language models are not well-defined. In this paper we report results from two experiments which test language production in a group of individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) in contrast to healthy aging and healthy young. The experiments apply factorial designs informed by linguistic analysis to test two forms of complex sentences involving anaphora (relations between pronouns and their antecedents). Results show that aMCI individuals differentiate forms of anaphora depending on sentence structure, with selective impairment of sentences which involve construal with reference to context (anaphoric coreference). We argue that aMCI individuals maintain core structural knowledge while evidencing deficiency in syntax-semantics integration, thus locating the source of the deficit in the language-thought interface of the Language Faculty.",

        "AbstractText": "As a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) might begin as much as two decades before the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Since the nature of the irreversible pathology of AD, early diagnosis provides a more tractable way for disease intervention and treatment. Therefore, numerous approaches have been developed for early diagnostic purposes. Although several important biomarkers have been established, most of the existing methods show limitations in describing the continuum of AD progression. However, understanding this continuous development is essential to understand the intrinsic progression mechanism of AD. In this work, we proposed a supervised deep tree model (SDTree) to integrate AD progression and individual prediction. The proposed SDTree method models the progression of AD as a tree embedded in a latent space using nonlinear reversed graph embedding. In this way, the continuum of AD progression is encoded into the locations on the tree structure. The learned tree structure can not only represent the continuum of AD but make predictions for new subjects. We evaluated our method on the classification task and achieved promising results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.",

        "AbstractText": "We investigated potentially promising imaging findings and their combinations in the evaluation of cognitive decline. This retrospective study included 138 patients with subjective cognitive impairments, who underwent brain MRI. We classified the same group of patients into Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD groups, based on the neuropsychiatric evaluation. We analyzed imaging findings, including white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), using the Kruskal-Wallis test for group comparison, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for assessing the diagnostic performance of imaging findings. CMBs in the lobar or deep locations demonstrated higher prevalence in the patients with AD compared to those in the non-AD group. The presence of lobar CMBs combined with periventricular WMH (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.702 [95% confidence interval: 0.599-0.806], p < 0.001) showed the highest performance in differentiation of AD from non-AD group.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that Glyceraldehyde (GA)-derived Toxic Advanced Glycation End-products (Toxic AGEs, TAGE) strongly showed cytotoxicity against neurons and induced similar alterations to those observed in AD. Further, GA induced dysfunctional neurite outgrowth via TAGE-\u03b2-- tubulin aggregation, which resulted in the TAGE-dependent abnormal aggregation of \u03b2-tubulin and tau phosphorylation. Herein, we provide a perspective on the possibility that T2DM increases the probability of AD onset and accelerates its progression.",

        "AbstractText": "In learning and memory tests that involve multiple presentations of the same material, learning slope refers to the degree to which examinees improve performances over successive learning trials. We aimed to quantitatively review the traditional raw learning slope (RLS), and the newly created learning ratio (LR) to understand the effects of demographic variables and clinical diagnoses on learning slope (e.g., limited improvement over multiple trials), and to develop demographically sensitive norms. A systematic literature search was conducted to evaluate the potential for these aims to be examined across the most popular contemporary multi-trial learning tests. Two databases were searched. Following this, hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine how demographic variables predict learning slope indices. These results were in turn used to contrast the performance of clinical groups with the predicted performance of demographically similar healthy controls. Finally, preliminary normative estimates for learning slope indices were presented. A total of 82 studies met criteria for inclusion in this study. However, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) was the only test to have sufficient trial-level learning and demographic data. Fifty-eight samples from 19 studies were quantitatively examined. Hierarchical linear models provided evidence of sex differences and a curvilinear decline in learning slope with age, with strongest and most consistent effects for LR relative to RLS. Regression-based norms for demographically corrected RLS and LR scores for the RAVLT are presented. The effect of clinical diagnoses was consistently stronger for LR, and Alzheimer's disease had the strongest effect, followed by invalid performances, severe traumatic brain injury, and seizures/epilepsy. Overall, LR enjoys both conceptual and demonstrated psychometric advantages over RLS. Replication of these findings can be completed by reanalyzing existing datasets. Further work may focus on the utility of using LR in diagnosis and prediction of clinical prognosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder. Its hallmarks involve abnormal proteostasis, which triggers proteotoxicity and induces neuronal dysfunction. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic nanomachine of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and contributes to eliminating these abnormal proteins. This study focused on the relationship between proteasome and AD, the hub genes of proteasome, PSMC6, and 7 genes of \u03b1-ring, are selected as targets to study. The following three characteristics were observed: 1. The total number of proteasomes decreased with AD progression because the proteotoxicity damaged the expression of proteasome proteins, as evidenced by the downregulation of hub genes. 2. The existing proteasomes exhibit increased activity and efficiency to counterbalance the decline in total proteasome numbers, as evidenced by enhanced global coordination and reduced systemic disorder of proteasomal subunits as AD advances. 3. The synergy of PSMC6 and \u03b1-ring subunits is associated with AD. Synergistic downregulation of PSMC6 and \u03b1-ring subunits reflects a high probability of AD risk. Regarding the above discovery, the following hypothesis is proposed: The aggregation of pathogenic proteins intensifies with AD progression, then proteasome becomes more active and facilitates the UPS selectively targets the degradation of abnormal proteins to maintain CNS proteostasis. In this paper, bioinformatics and support vector machine learning methods are applied and combined with multivariate statistical analysis of microarray data. Additionally, the concept of entropy was used to detect the disorder of proteasome system, it was discovered that entropy is down-regulated continually with AD progression against system chaos caused by AD. Another conception of the matrix determinant was used to detect the global coordination of proteasome, it was discovered that the coordination is enhanced to maintain the efficiency of degradation. The features of entropy and determinant suggest that active proteasomes resist the attack caused by AD like defenders, on the one hand, to protect themselves (entropy reduces), and on the other hand, to fight the enemy (determinant reduces). It is noted that these are results from biocomputing and need to be supported by further biological experiments.",

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of gait disorders and gait-related neuropsychological performances for future AD diagnosis in aMCI through machine learning (ML). A sample of 253 aMCI (stable, converter) individuals were included. We explored the predictive accuracy of four predictors (gait profile plus MMSE, DSST, and TMT-B) previously identified as critical for the conversion from aMCI to AD within a 36-month follow-up. Supervised ML algorithms (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors) were trained on 70% of the dataset, and feature importance was evaluated for the best algorithm. The SVM algorithm achieved the best performance. The optimized training set performance achieved an accuracy of 0.67 (sensitivity = 0.72; specificity = 0.60), improving to 0.70 on the test set (sensitivity = 0.79; specificity = 0.52). Feature importance revealed MMSE as the most important predictor in both training and testing, while gait type was important in the testing phase. We created a predictive ML model that is capable of identifying aMCI at high risk of AD dementia within 36 months. Our ML model could be used to quickly identify individuals at higher risk of AD, facilitating secondary prevention (e.g., cognitive and/or physical training), and serving as screening for more expansive and invasive tests.

While the health system has begun grappling with the chronic conditions that will accompany an aging society, the criminal system has yet to meaningfully respond. Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by impairment in cognitive domains (memory, executive function, visuospatial). Additionally, dementia often includes behavioral symptoms that increase the likelihood that an individual's actions may violate social norms and in some circumstances be deemed criminal. Prior studies have established criminal behavior as a trend among individuals living with dementia. Yet, the criminal system has yet to establish protections for individuals who commit a crime while impaired by dementia. This paper will report on an empirical study to evaluate the treatment of persons with dementia within the criminal justice system. We will report on interviews with attorneys (n=15) regarding their experience and perspective on the treatment of persons with dementia post-arrest. In the paper, we will explore topics identified through these interviews including pre-trial release, competency, placement (housing), criminal liability determination, sentencing, and post-conviction release. We will highlight key findings including the lack of a systematic screening process for dementia post-arrest, placement is a significant challenge, attorneys' lack of training on dementia to be able to understand how the disease could impact decision-making, and the two legal mechanisms available to divert miss the mark given their focus on psychiatric populations.

We applied replica permutation with solute tempering (RPST) to the system of A\u03b2 fragments, A\u03b2(16-22), and polyphenols to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation. The RPST molecular dynamics simulations were performed for two polyphenols, myricetin (MYC) and rosmarinic acid (ROA). Two A\u03b2 fragments were distant, and the number of residues forming the intermolecular \u03b2-sheet was reduced in the presence of MYC and ROA compared with that in the absence of polyphenols. MYC was found to interact with glutamic acid and phenylalanine of A\u03b2 fragments. These interactions induce helix structure formation of A\u03b2 fragments, making it difficult to form \u03b2-sheet. ROA interacted with glutamic acid and lysine, which reduced the hydrophilic interaction between A\u03b2 fragments. These results indicate that these polyphenols inhibit the aggregation of A\u03b2 fragments with different mechanisms.",

Furthermore, the presence of outliers can introduce unwanted bias, which affect estimates derived from linear regression models. Although a variety of data transformations can be utilized to mitigate these problems, these approaches are also associated with various caveats. By contrast, a robust regression approach does not impose distributional assumptions on data allowing for results to be interpreted in a similar manner to that derived using a linear regression analysis. Here, we demonstrate the utility of applying robust regression to the analysis of data derived from studies of human brain neurodegeneration where the error distribution of a dependent variable does not meet the assumption of normality. We show that the application of a robust regression approach to two independent published human clinical neuropathologic data sets provides reliable estimates of associations. We also demonstrate that results from a linear regression analysis can be biased if the dependent variable is significantly skewed, further indicating robust regression as a suitable alternate approach.",

        "AbstractText": "Subcritical epileptiform activity is associated with impaired cognitive function and is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The anti-convulsant, levetiracetam (LEV), is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its ability to reduce epileptiform activity and improve cognitive function in AD. The purpose of the current study was to apply pharmacokinetics (PK), network analysis of medical imaging, gene transcriptomics, and PK/PD modeling to a cohort of amyloidogenic mice to establish how LEV restores or drives alterations in the brain networks of mice in a dose-dependent basis using the rigorous preclinical pipeline of the MODEL-AD Preclinical Testing Core. Chronic LEV was administered to 5XFAD mice of both sexes for 3\u2009months based on allometrically scaled clinical dose levels from PK models. Data collection and analysis consisted of a multi-modal approach utilizing 18F-FDG PET/MRI imaging and analysis, transcriptomic analyses, and PK/PD modeling. Pharmacokinetics of LEV showed a sex and dose dependence in Cmax, CL/F, and AUC0-\u221e, with simulations used to estimate dose regimens. Chronic dosing at 10, 30, and 56\u2009mg/kg, showed 18F-FDG specific regional differences in brain uptake, and in whole brain covariance measures such as clustering coefficient, degree, network density, and connection strength (i.e., positive and negative). In addition, transcriptomic analysis via nanoString showed dose-dependent changes in gene expression in pathways consistent 18F-FDG uptake and network changes, and PK/PD modeling showed a concentration dependence for key genes, but not for network covariance modeling. This study represents the first report detailing the relationships of metabolic covariance and transcriptomic network changes resulting from LEV administration in 5XFAD mice. Overall, our results highlight non-linear kinetics based on dose and sex, where gene expression analysis demonstrated LEV dose- and concentration-dependent changes, along with cerebral metabolism, and/or cerebral homeostatic mechanisms relevant to human AD, which aligned closely with network covariance analysis of 18F-FDG images. Collectively, this study show cases the value of a multimodal connectomic, transcriptomic, and pharmacokinetic approach to further investigate dose dependent relationships in preclinical studies, with translational value toward informing clinical study design.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: The incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been found to be associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to the common properties of neurodegeneration, their progressions are involved with abnormal vascular functions. However, the interactions between them have not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the key factor for the underlying interactions and shared signaling pathways in the vasculature of DR and AD. Methods: We retrieved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data regarding human fibrovascular membrane (FVM) of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and human hippocampus vessels of AD from the NCBI-GEO database. GSEA analysis was performed to analyze AD-related genes in endothelial cells and pericytes of PDR. CellChat was used for predicting cell-cell communication and the signaling pathway. Results: The data suggested that amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) signaling was found crucial in the vasculature of PDR and AD. Endothelial cells and pericytes could pose influences on other cells mainly via APP signaling in PDR. The endothelial cells were mainly coordinated with macrophages in the hippocampus vasculature of AD via APP signaling. The bulk RNA-seq in mice with PDR validated that the expression of APP gene had a significant correlation with that of the AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) gene. Discussion: Our study demonstrates that the vasculopathy of PDR and AD is likely to share a common signaling pathway, of which the APP-related pathway is a potential target.",

Here, a novel approach is being proposed and developed to induce and assess those diseases. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is applied to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model of systemic oxidative stress to induce rapid A\u03b2 accumulation. Excised brains are evaluated by Brillouin-Raman spectroscopy and microscopy with UV surface emissions (MUSE) to interrogate physical property changes due to fixation and high-dose PDT. MUSE reveals reasonable autofluorescence in the spectral range of A\u03b2, particularly for females, with increased signal once stained. A presence of significant mechanical changes in fresh brains treated with PDT compared to healthy controls is revealed using Brillouin spectroscopy. A\u03b2 plaque presence was confirmed with confocal analysis, with female PDT flies yielding nearly four-fold the mean intensity of controls, thus marking PDT as a potential neurodegenerative disease model. MUSE may serve as a viable early screening method for A\u03b2 presence and quantification in a research setting.

Moreover, the regenerative potential of stem cells can be improved with the use of biologically active compounds. Our study was designed to explore the effect of honokiol, a small polyphenol molecule extracted from Magnolia officinalis, on the survival and culture time of iPSC-derived neurons from a sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient. This study aimed to generate iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an AD patient using episomal plasmids with a nucleofector system and differentiate them into neurons. These iPSC-derived neurons were used to investigate the effect of honokiol extracted from M. officinalis on their survival and long-term cultures. IPSCs were generated from PBMCs of an AD patient by introducing Oct-3/4, Sox2, Klf4, L-Myc, and Lin28 using NucleofectorTM Technology. Differentiation of neurons derived from iPSCs was carried out using inducers and recognized by biomarkers. The viability of iPSC-derived neurons with the addition of honokiol extracted from the bark of M. officinalis was determined by the MTT analytical kit. IPSCs were generated by reprogramming AD patient-derived PBMCs and subsequently converted into neurons. The survival and growth of iPSC-derived neurons were significantly enhanced by adding honokiol in the experiment conditions. AD iPSC-derived neurons had a high viability rate when cultured in the presence of honokiol. These results have shown that AD iPSC-derived neurons can be an excellent model for screening neurotrophic agents and improving the conditions for long-term cultures of human iPSC-derived neurons.

        "AbstractText": "According to a large number of scientific reports, the main problem is COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy which slowed down the vaccination program. Previous studies revealed that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is associated with lower cognitive performance. However, the neurobiology of such behavior is less known, and investigating the brain structural patterns in this regard can extend our knowledge on the basis of this behavior. This study aimed to investigate the link between brain structural features including cortical and subcortical volume with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in elderly individuals. A total of 221 healthy subjects without any cognitive impairment with a mean age of 63.7 \u00b1 6.1 were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Overall, 87 vaccine-hesitant (VH) and 134 vaccine-accepted (VA) were entered into this study. The difference in the volume of cortical and subcortical regions was investigated between VH and VA groups. There was no significant difference in cognitive status measured by MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-cog, and RAVLT between VA and VH groups (P>0.05). The analysis showed that VA subjects had significantly higher left pars orbitalis (P: 0.013), left precentral (P: 0.042), right caudal anterior cingulate (P: 0.044), and right isthmus cingulate (P: 0.013) volume compared to the VH group. There was no significant difference in other cortical and subcortical regions. In conclusion, this finding demonstrated that in the era of complicated decision-making due to social media reports, elderly adults with smaller frontal and cingulate regions are more likely to be vaccine-hesitant.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and the leading factor in dementia in the elderly. We examined the impact of Rn on scopolamine (Sco)-induced dementia in rats. Thirty-two albino male rats were divided into four groups: control, Rn, Sco, and Rn\u2009+\u2009Sco. A significant decrease in the escape latency in the Morris water maze test after pre-treatment with Rn explained better learning and memory in rats. Additionally, Rn significantly upregulated the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the treated group compared to the Sco group but substantially reduced acetylcholinesterase activity levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, Rn dramatically reduced interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 and upregulated the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, in the Sco group, the hippocampal tissue's immunohistochemical reaction of Tau and glial factor activating protein (GFAP) was significantly increased in addition to the upregulation of the Caspase-3 gene expression, which was markedly improved by pre-treatment with Rn. The majority of pyramidal neurons had large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and appeared to be more or less normal, reflecting the all-beneficial effects of Rn when the hippocampal tissue was examined under a microscope. Our findings indicated that Rn, through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as the control of the expression of GFAP, BDNF, and Tau proteins, has a novel neuroprotective impact against scopolamine-induced dementia in rats.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurologic disease and the most common cause of dementia. Classic pathology in AD is characterized by inflammation, abnormal presence of tau protein, and aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid that disrupt normal neuronal function and lead to cell death. Deficits in communication also occur during disease progression and significantly reduce health, well-being, and quality of life. Because clinical diagnosis occurs in the mid-stage of the disease, characterizing the prodrome and early stages in humans is currently challenging. To overcome these challenges, we use the validated TgF344-AD (F344-Tg(Prp-APP, Prp-PS1)19/Rrrc) transgenic rat model that manifests cognitive, behavioral, and neuropathological dysfunction akin to AD in humans. The overarching goal of our work is to test the central hypothesis that pathology and related behavioral deficits such as communication dysfunction in part manifest in the peripheral nervous system and corresponding target tissues already in the early stages. The primary aims of this study are to test the hypotheses that: (1) changes in ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) occur in the prodromal stage at 6\u2009months of age and worsen at 9\u2009months of age, (2) inflammation as well as AD-related pathology can be found in the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) at 12\u2009months of age (experimental endpoint tissue harvest), and to (3) demonstrate that the TgF344-AD rat model is an appropriate model for preclinical investigations of early AD-related vocal deficits. USVs were collected from male TgF344-AD (N\u2009=\u200919) and wildtype (WT) Fischer-344 rats (N\u2009=\u200919) at 6 months (N\u2009=\u200938; WT: n\u2009=\u200919; TgF344-AD: n\u2009=\u200919) and 9 months of age (N\u2009=\u200918; WT: n\u2009=\u200910; TgF344-AD: n\u2009=\u20098) and acoustically analyzed for duration, mean power, principal frequency, low frequency, high frequency, peak frequency, and call type. RT-qPCR was used to assay peripheral inflammation and AD-related pathology via gene expressions in the TA muscle of male TgF344-AD rats (n\u2009=\u20096) and WT rats (n\u2009=\u20096) at 12\u2009months of age. This study revealed a significant reduction in mean power of ultrasonic calls from 6 to 9\u2009months of age and increased peak frequency levels over time in TgF344-AD rats compared to WT controls. Additionally, significant downregulation of AD-related genes Uqcrc2, Bace2, Serpina3n, and Igf2, as well as downregulation of pro-inflammatory gene Myd88 was found in the TA muscle of TgF344-AD rats at 12\u2009months of age. Our findings demonstrate early and progressive vocal deficits in the TgF344-AD rat model. We further provide evidence of dysregulation of AD-pathology-related genes as well as inflammatory genes in the TA muscles of TgF344-AD rats in the early stage of the disease, confirming this rat model for early-stage investigations of voice deficits and related pathology.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of MKP-1 on AD have not been extensively studied. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, thereby repressing mRNA translation. Here, we reported that the microRNA-429-3p (miR-429-3p) was significantly increased in the brain of APP23/PS45 AD model mice and N2AAPP AD model cells. We further found that miR-429-3p could downregulate MKP-1 expression by directly binding to its 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR). Inhibition of\u00a0miR-429-3p by its antagomir (A-miR-429) restored the expression of MKP-1 to a control level and consequently reduced the amyloidogenic processing of APP and A\u03b2 accumulation. More importantly,\u00a0intranasal administration of A-miR-429 successfully ameliorated the deficits of hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2)-mediated GluA1 hyperphosphorylation at Ser831 site, thereby increasing the surface expression of GluA1-containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Together, these results demonstrate that inhibiting miR-429-3p to upregulate MKP-1 effectively improves cognitive and synaptic functions in AD model mice, suggesting that miR-429/MKP-1 pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for AD treatment.",

Extensive genome-wide association studies have established a distinct susceptibility link between the protein tyrosine kinase 2\u03b2 (PTK2B) gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but the specific pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. PTK2B is known to be expressed in neurons, and recent research has revealed its more important significance in microglia. Elucidating the role of PTK2B high expression in microglia in AD's progression is crucial for uncovering novel pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Our review of existing studies suggests a close relationship between PTK2B/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and tau pathology, and this process might be \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) dependence. Pyk2 is hypothesized as a pivotal target linking A\u03b2 and tau pathologies. Concurrently, A\u03b2-activated Pyk2 participates in the regulation of microglial activation and its proinflammatory functions. Consequently, it is reasonable to presume that Pyk2 in microglia contributes to amyloid-induced tau pathology in AD via a neuroinflammatory pathway. Furthermore, many things remain unclear, such as identifying the specific pathways that lead to the release of downstream inflammatory factors due to Pyk2 phosphorylation and whether all types of inflammatory factors can activate neuronal kinase pathways. Additionally, further in vivo experiments are essential to validate this hypothesized pathway. Considering PTK2B/Pyk2's potential role in AD pathogenesis, targeting this pathway may offer innovative and promising therapeutic approaches for AD.",

Understanding the factors involved in dementia attitude formation in adolescents is useful for the development of evidence-based anti-stigma initiatives. This study aims to identify predictors of dementia attitudes in adolescents.

Multiple regressions were employed as well as a path analysis via a structural equation model to test for direct and mediatory effects. Multiple regression models revealed that being female, having higher levels of contact with dementia, and higher levels of empathy are positively associated with dementia attitudes in adolescents (p<0.05).

        "AbstractText": "Spatial representations in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) are fundamental to cognitive functions like navigation and memory. These representations, embodied in spatial field maps, dynamically remap in response to environmental changes. However, current methods, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, struggle to capture the complexity of these remapping events, especially when fields do not overlap, or transformations are non-linear. This limitation hinders our understanding and quantification of remapping, a key aspect of spatial memory function. We propose a family of metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a versatile framework for characterizing remapping. The EMD provides a granular, noise-resistant, and rate-robust description of remapping. This approach enables the identification of specific cell types and the characterization of remapping in various scenarios, including disease models. Furthermore, the EMD's properties can be manipulated to identify spatially tuned cell types and to explore remapping as it relates to alternate information forms such as spatiotemporal coding. We present a feasible, lightweight approach that complements traditional methods. Our findings underscore the potential of the EMD as a powerful tool for enhancing our understanding of remapping in the brain and its implications for spatial navigation, memory studies and beyond.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Pathologically, the disease is marked by neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are aberrant accumulations of the tau protein that develop inside neurons, and extracellular plaque deposits of the amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). These pathological lesions are present in the brain before the beginning of clinical manifestations. However, despite advancements in the comprehension of AD pathophysiology, timely and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging. Therefore, developing biomarkers capable of detecting AD during the preclinical phase holds enormous promise for precise diagnosis since detecting the disease early is crucial because it enables interventions when treatments may be more effective. This article intends to provide a comprehensive review of AD biomarkers, discussing their significance, classification, and recent developments in the field.",

Eighty participants with probable AD dementia, 50 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 19 with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) underwent baseline and follow-up evaluations of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and both plasma biomarkers. Baseline MDS-OA\u00df (p = 0.016) and NfL (p = 0.002) plasma concentrations differed significantly among groups, but only NfL correlated with baseline MMSE scores (r = -0.278, p = 0.001). In follow-up, neither correlated with MMSE changes overall. However, in SCD and MCI participants (n = 32), baseline MDS-OA\u00df correlated with follow-up MMSE scores (r = 0.532, p = 0.041). Linear regression revealed a relationship between baseline MDS-OA\u03b2 and follow-up MMSE scores. In SCD and MCI participants, plasma NfL changes correlated with MMSE changes (r = 0.564, p = 0.028). This study shows that only in participants with SCD and MCI, not including AD dementia, can MDS-OA\u00df predict the longitudinal cognitive decline measured by follow-up MMSE.

        "AbstractText": "Accurate modelling of molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for understanding the mechanisms driving neuronal pathology and for developing treatments. Synaptic dysfunction has long been implicated as a mechanism underpinning memory dysfunction in AD and may result in part from changes in adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) mediated RNA editing of the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors and changes in AMPA receptor function at the post synaptic cleft. However, few studies have investigated changes in proteins which influence RNA editing and notably, AD studies that focus on studying changes in protein expression, rather than changes in mRNA, often use traditional western blotting. Here, we demonstrate the value of automated capillary western blotting to investigate the protein expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluA1-4), the ADAR RNA editing proteins (ADAR1-3), and proteins known to regulate RNA editing (PIN1, WWP2, FXR1P, and CREB1), in the J20 AD mouse model. We describe extensive optimisation and validation of the automated capillary western blotting method, demonstrating the use of total protein to normalise protein load, in addition to characterising the optimal protein/antibody concentrations to ensure accurate protein quantification. Following this, we assessed changes in proteins of interest in the hippocampus of 44-week-old J20 AD mice. We observed an increase in the expression of ADAR1 p110 and GluA3 and a decrease in ADAR2 in the hippocampus of 44-week-old J20 mice. These changes signify a shift in the balance of proteins that play a critical role at the synapse. Regression analysis revealed unique J20-specific correlations between changes in AMPA receptor subunits, ADAR enzymes, and proteins that regulate ADAR stability in J20 mice, highlighting potential mechanisms mediating RNA-editing changes found in AD. Our findings in J20 mice generally reflect changes seen in the human AD brain. This study underlines the importance of novel techniques, like automated capillary western blotting, to assess protein expression in AD. It also provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that a dysregulation in RNA editing-related proteins may play a role in the initiation and/or progression of AD.",

However, studies of gray matter changes have produced varied estimates of which structures are implicated in MDD and dementia. Changes in gray matter volume and cortical thickness are macrostructural measures for the microstructural processes of free water accumulation and dendritic spine loss. We conducted multishell diffusion imaging to assess gray matter microstructure in 244 older adults with remitted MDD (n\u00a0= 44), MCI (n\u00a0= 115), remitted MDD+MCI (n\u00a0= 61), or without psychiatric disorders or cognitive impairment (healthy control participants; n\u00a0= 24). We estimated measures related to neurite density, orientation dispersion, and free water (isotropic volume\u00a0fraction) using a biophysically plausible model (neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging). Results showed that increasing age was correlated with an increase in isotropic volume\u00a0fraction and a decrease in orientation dispersion index, which is consistent with neuropathology dendritic loss. In addition, this relationship between age and increased isotropic volume\u00a0fraction was more disrupted in the MCI group than in the remitted MDD or healthy control groups. However, the association between age and orientation dispersion index was similar for all 3 groups. The findings suggest that the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures could be used to identify biological risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, signifying both conventional neurodegeneration observed with MCI and dendritic loss seen in MDD.",

Memory complaint is a common condition in the general population and can indicate normal brain aging as well as incurable neurodegenerative disease or curable disorders. Therefore, the role of any primary care physician is crucial for the referral to further investigations. Furthermore, the pitfall of underdiagnosis, often related to the current incurability of the suspected cause, is contrary to all current guidelines. When facing a memory complaint, the primary care consultation has four objectives: to identify the possible red flags amongst the memory complaint and the memory complaint severity, to objectify a neurocognitive disorder associated with the memory complaint using cognitive tests, to search for associated signs, and to screen for obvious, frequent, and curable causes of memory complaint. The article is intended to be a practical tool aligned with the 2018 French multidisciplinary recommendations regarding the graded and personalized strategy for diagnosing neurocognitive disorders. It details the possibly worrisome elements to be collected in the history, the elements that need special attention or assessment, and finally, the course of action to be taken after a primary care consultation.

        "AbstractText": "MEMORY DISEASES. There are many diseases that permanently affect longterm memory and all of them have in common that they permanently and usually bilaterally disrupt specific neural circuits that underlie it. In the forefront is the Papez circuit, or hippocampo-mamillo-thalamo-cingular circuit, which is also connected to the fronto-basal regions. Its impairment leads to disorders of episodic memory, with relative preservation of semantic memory and implicit learning. The anterior temporal pole is a hub allowing access to general knowledge distributed in the cortex. Its damage results in an amnesic picture in which the loss of semantic memory dominates. The richness of memory disorders is largely deduced, in its nuances, from the lesion topographies. The most frequent aetiology of memory diseases is represented by neurodegenerative diseases, dominated by Alzheimer's disease, but the semiology of these is by far not limited to a memory disorder, because of the diffusion of lesions. Dysimmune, infectious or toxic encephalitis affecting the hippocampi, Korsakoff's syndrome affecting the thalamus and mamillary bodies, \u00ab semantic dementia \u00bb affecting the temporal pole, give pictures where memory disorders are in the foreground with remarkable semiological nuances.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with multiple pathologic factors, with cognitive decline being the main manifestation of AD. The neuroprotective effects of berberine in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been widely reported, exhibiting protective effects against risk factors associated with AD. In this study, we summarize and evaluate the effects of berberine on cognitive function and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein in animal models of AD. Material and methods: Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to 1 June 2023. Risk of bias was assessed by the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experiments (SYRCLE). Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 and Review Manger 5.4 software to calculate weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), Morris water maze (MWM) test and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein as outcome measures. Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 test. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also assessed. Results: 19 studies involving 360 animals met the inclusion criteria, and the results of the meta-analysis showed that berberine decreased escape latency (SMD = -2.19, 95% CI: (-2.50, -1.88), p < 0.00001), increased the number of platform crossings (SMD = 4.27, 95% CI (3.38, 5.17), p < 0.00001), time in the target quadrant (SMD = 5.92, 95% CI (4.43, 7.41), p < 0.00001) and APP expression (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: (0.25, 1.21), p = 0.003). Conclusion: Berberine can regulate APP expression and improve cognitive function in animal models of AD, and the mechanism may be related to the involvement of berberine in APP processing and influence the expression of its related factors.

One of the causes is the inability of the substance to reach the brain in therapeutic quantities. These pharmaceuticals lacked targeted mechanisms for drug delivery, coming about in an elevated drug concentration in imperative organs, which drove to drug harmfulness. In recent years, cell-free treatment (conditioned medium) determined from animal and human stem cells has provided new promise for treating brain diseases, as CM can stimulate the regeneration of neurons and prevent the inflammation and apoptotic of neurons caused by pathology or aging. On the other hand, it is well known that chitosan-hydrogel (CH) is a polymer derived from natural sources. It has been authorized for use in biomedical use because of its uncommon biodegradability, biocompatibility, and mucoadhesive properties. CH modification has been utilized to generate nanoparticles (NPs) for intranasal and intravenous brain targeting. NPs shown upgraded drug take-up to the brain with decreased side impacts due to their drawn out contact time with the nasal mucosa, surface charge, nanosize, and capacity to extend the tight intersections inside the mucosa.

The A\u03b2 trimer mimic is covalently stabilized by three disulfide bonds at the corners of the triangular trimer to create a homogeneous oligomer. Structural, biophysical, and cell-based studies demonstrate that the A\u03b2 trimer mimic shares characteristics with oligomers of full-length A\u03b2. X-ray crystallography elucidates the structure of the trimer and reveals that four copies of the trimer assemble to form a dodecamer. SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and dynamic light scattering reveal that the trimer also forms higher-order assemblies in solution. Cell-based toxicity assays show that the trimer elicits LDH release, decreases ATP levels, and activates caspase-3/7 mediated apoptosis. Immunostaining studies on brain slices from people who lived with Alzheimer's disease and people who lived with Down syndrome reveal that the polyclonal antibodies raised against the A\u03b2 trimer mimic recognize pathological features including different types of A\u03b2 plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.",

Moreover, the conformational transition from helix to sheet is considered a crucial step in the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides. However, the structural details of this process still remain unclear due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of the A\u03b2 peptides. In this study, we developed an enhanced sampling strategy that combines artificial neural networks (ANN) with metadynamics to explore the conformational space of the A\u03b242 peptides. The strategy consists of two parts: applying ANN to optimize CVs and conducting metadynamics based on the resulting CVs to sample conformations. The results showed that this strategy achieved better sampling performance in terms of the distribution of sampled conformations. The sampling efficiency is increased by 10-fold compared to our previous Hamiltonian Exchange Molecular Dynamics (MD) and by 1000-fold compared to ordinary MD. Based on the sampled conformations, we constructed a Markov state model to understand the detailed transition process. The intermediate states in this process are identified, and the connecting paths are analyzed. The conformational transitions in D23-K28 and M35-V40 are proven to be crucial for aggregation. These results are helpful in clarifying the mechanism and process of A\u03b242 peptide aggregation.

However, to date all haplotype-disease associations have not excluded recombination interference among multiple loci and hence some results might be confounded by recombination interference. Association of sister haplotypes with a complex disease, based on recombination disequilibrium (RD) was presented. Sister haplotypes can be determined by translating notation of DNA base haplotypes to notation of genetic genotypes. Sister haplotypes provide haplotype pairs available for haplotype-disease association analysis. After performing RD tests in control and case cohorts, a two-by-two contingency table can be constructed using sister haplotype pair and case-control pair. With this standard two-by-two table, one can perform classical Chi-square test to find statistical haplotype-disease association. Applying this method to a haplotype dataset of Alzheimer disease (AD), association of sister haplotypes containing ApoE3/4 with risk for AD was identified under no RD. Haplotypes within gene IL-13 were not associated with risk for breast cancer in the case of no RD and no association of haplotypes in gene IL-17A with risk for coronary artery disease were detected without RD. The previously reported associations of haplotypes within these genes with risk for these diseases might be due to strong RD and/or inappropriate haplotype pairs.",

Despite significant clinical advancements in stroke therapy, stroke remains a prominent contributor to both mortality and disability worldwide. Brain injury resulting from an ischemic stroke is a dynamic process that unfolds over time. Initially, an infarct core forms due to the abrupt and substantial blockage of blood flow. In the subsequent hours to days, the surrounding tissue undergoes gradual deterioration, primarily driven by sustained hypoperfusion, programmed cell death, and inflammation. While anti-inflammatory strategies have proven highly effective in experimental models of stroke, their successful translation to clinical use has proven challenging. To overcome this translational hurdle, a better understanding of the distinct immune response driving ischemic stroke brain injury is needed. In this review article, we give an overview of current knowledge regarding the immune response in ischemic stroke and the contribution of immunothrombosis to this process.

Brain health definitions range from broad to narrow in scope and may focus on cognition or encompass broader core components such as cerebral, mental and social domains. In this manuscript we will explore various definitions of brain health and its core components, the importance of cognitive and functional domains, and briefly introduce the concept of cognitive medicine in the context of brain health.",

        "AbstractText": "Sociocontextual factors powerfully shape risk for age-related cognitive impairment, including excess risk burdening medically underserved populations. Lifecourse adversity associates with cognitive aging, but harms are likely mitigable. Understanding population-salient relationships and sensitive periods for exposure is crucial for targeting clinical interventions. The authors examined childhood and adulthood traumatic events in relation to cognition among Black and White older adults in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Participants (N = 13,952) aged 55+ had complete lifetime trauma and cognitive testing data at the 2006/08, 2010/12, and/or 2014/16 waves. Trauma indices comprised childhood and adulthood event counts. Outcomes included baseline performance and trajectories on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Main and nonlinear trauma effects were modeled via linear regression, and overall contributions assessed with omnibus likelihood ratio tests. Black participants (N = 2,345) reported marginally lower adulthood trauma exposure than White participants (N = 11,607) with no other exposure differentials observed. In White participants only, greater childhood trauma exposure predicted worse baseline cognition but slower change over time. Across race, adulthood trauma robustly associated with baseline cognition. Relationships were frequently nonlinear: low but nonzero trauma predicted highest cognitive scores, with much poorer cognition observed as trauma exposure increased. Relationships between adulthood trauma and trajectory were limited to the White sample. Traumatic experiences, particularly in adulthood, may impact late-life cognitive health if not addressed. Findings highlight foci for clinical researchers and providers: adverse life events as a source of cognitive risk, and identification of community-specific resources that buffer behavioral, physical, and mental health sequelae of previous and incident trauma.",

To aid in the development of IDO inhibitors as potential AD therapeutics, we optimized a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) based mouse model of brain IDO1 inhibition by examining the dosedependent and time-course of the brain kynurenine:tryptophan (K:T) ratio to LPS via intraperitoneal dosing. We determined the optimal LPS dose to increase IDO1 activity in the brain, and the ideal time point to quantify the brain K:T ratio after LPS administration. We then used a brain penetrant tool compound, EOS200271, to validate the model, determine the optimal dosing profile and found that a complete rescue of the K:T ratio was possible with the tool compound. This LPS-based model of IDO1 target engagement is a useful tool that can be used in the development of brain penetrant IDO1 inhibitors for AD. A limitation of the present study is the lack of quantification of potential clinically relevant biomarkers in this model, which could be addressed in future studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or dementia is a prevalent neurocognitive disorder primarily affecting individuals over the age of 65. Identifying specific causes of AD and/or dementia can be challenging, with emerging evidence suggesting a potential association with autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to assess the prevalence rate of AD and/or dementia among Medicare beneficiaries reporting an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, this study sought to identify the comparative prevalence of AD and/or dementia in patients with an autoimmune disorder who were using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) compared to those not using DMARDs. Cross-sectional secondary data analyses were conducted on Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data from 2017 and 2018. The MCBS data consists of a nationally representative sample of the Medicare population, a population that is largely 65 and older, and provides de-identified patient information. Patients from this dataset with a self-reported autoimmune disorder were included in the analyses. Descriptive analyses were conducted on demographic variables, chronic conditions, and medication use. The prevalence of AD and/or dementia was compared between patients with and without an autoimmune disorder. A backward stepwise selection regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with the prevalence of AD and/or dementia. The study included 18,929 Medicare beneficiaries, with 4,405 identified as having one autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of AD and/or dementia was significantly higher in patients with an autoimmune disorder. The multivariate regression showed that RA was significantly associated with a higher risk of AD and/or dementia. Other demographic factors, including advanced age, African-American or Hispanic ethnicity, low body mass index, and chronic conditions of ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, history of stroke, depression, mental health disorder(s), and traumatic brain injury also showed statistically significant associations with AD and/or dementia. Patients using DMARDs demonstrated a reduced likelihood of having AD and/or dementia, compared to patients not using DMARDs. This study provides evidence of an association between RA and increased risk of AD and/or dementia. The findings suggest that DMARD use may have a protective effect against the development of AD and/or dementia in patients with an autoimmune disorder.",

        "AbstractText": "The calibrator in immunoassay plays an essential role in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, the most well-studied biomarkers for AD diagnosis are three phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau): p-Tau231, p-Tau217, and p-Tau181. Glycogen synthase-3beta (GSK3\u03b2)-phosphorated Tau-441 is the most commonly used calibrator for p-Tau immunoassays. However, the batch-to-batch inconsistency issue of the commonly used GSK3\u03b2-phosphorylated Tau-441 limits its clinical application. We have successfully generated and characterized 61 Tau monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct epitopes by using the hybridoma technique and employed them as capture or detection antibodies for p-Tau immunoassays. Through chemical synthesis, we synthesized calibrators, which are three peptides including capture and detection antibody epitopes, for application in immunoassays that detect p-Tau231, p-Tau217, and p-Tau181. The novel calibrators were applied to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Single-molecule array (Simoa) platforms to validate their applicability and establish a range of p-Tau immunoassays. By employing the hybridoma technique, 49 mAbs recognizing Tau (1-22), nine mAbs targeting p-Tau231, one mAb targeting p-Tau217, and two mAbs targeting p-Tau181 were developed. Peptides, including recognition epitopes of capture and detection antibodies, were synthesized. These peptides were used as calibrators to develop 60 immunoassays on the ELISA platform, of which six highly sensitive immunoassays were selected and applied to the ultra-sensitive Simoa platform. Remarkably, the LODs were 2.5, 2.4, 31.1, 32.9, 46.9, and 52.1\u2009pg/ml, respectively. Three novel p-Tau calibrators were successfully generated and validated, which solved the batch-to-batch inconsistency issue of GSK3\u03b2-phosphorylated Tau-441. The novel calibrators exhibit the potential to promote the standardization of clinical AD diagnostic calibrators. Furthermore, we established a series of highly sensitive and specific immunoassays on the Simoa platform based on novel calibrators, which moved a steady step forward in p-Tau immunoassay application for AD diagnosis.",

Although currently available CBD products do not meet the safety standards of most food safety authorities to be approved as a dietary supplement or food additive, CBD has been gaining widespread attention in recent years due to its various potential health benefits. While primarily known for its therapeutic effects in managing epileptic seizures, psychosis, anxiety, (neuropathic) pain, and inflammation, CBD's influence on brain function has also piqued the interest of researchers and individuals seeking to enhance cognitive performance. The primary objective of this review is to gather, synthesize, and consolidate scientifically proven evidence on the impact of CBD on brain function and its therapeutic significance in treating neurological and mental disorders. First, basic background information on CBD, including its biomolecular properties and mechanisms of action is presented. Next, evidence for CBD effects in the human brain is provided followed by a discussion on the potential implications of CBD as a neurotherapeutic agent. The potential effectiveness of CBD in reducing chronic pain is considered but also in reducing the symptoms of various brain disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the implications of using CBD to manage psychiatric conditions such as psychosis, anxiety and fear, depression, and substance use disorders are explored. An overview of the beneficial effects of CBD on aspects of human behavior, such as sleep, motor control, cognition and memory, is then provided. As CBD products remain largely unregulated, it is crucial to address the ethical concerns associated with their use, including product quality, consistency, and safety. Therefore, this review discusses the need for responsible research and regulation of CBD to ensure its safety and efficacy as a therapeutic agent for brain disorders or to stimulate behavioral and cognitive abilities of healthy individuals.",

Herb pairs are the most fundamental form of multi-herb formulae. Among the Chinese herbal formulas for AD treatment, Polygala tenuifolia (PT) and Acorus tatarinowii (AT) appeared as the most commonly used herbal pairs in combination. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the combination of PT and AT in the treatment of AD. Methods: We systematically searched and screened randomized controlled trials of pairing PT and AT for the treatment of AD patients in eight databases with a search deadline of June 26, 2023. Authors, year of publication, title, and basic information such as subject characteristics (age, sex, and race), course of disease, control interventions, dose, and treatment duration were extracted from the screened studies. Primary outcomes assessed included mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL), and AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), while secondary outcomes included efficiency and adverse events. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (MD [95% CI]) and risk ratio (RR) was selected as the effect size, and the data were analyzed and evaluated using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 16. Results: A total of sixteen eligible and relevant studies involving 1103 AD participants were included. The combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs was superior to single conventional drugs in MMSE [MD = 2.57, 95%CI: (1.44, 3.69); p < 0.00001; I 2 = 86%], ADL [MD = -3.19, 95%CI: (-4.29, -2.09); p < 0.00001; I 2 = 0%], and ADAS-cog scores [MD = -2.09, 95%CI: (-3.07, -1.10); p < 0.0001; I 2 = 0%]. The combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs had a significantly more favorable benefit in clinical effectiveness [RR = 1.27, 95%CI: (1.12, 1.44); p = 0.0002; I 2 = 0%]. Adverse events were not increased with the combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs compared to conventional drugs [RR = 0.65, 95%CI: (0.35, 1.19); p = 0.16; I 2 = 0%]. The experimental group treated with the combination of PT and AT alone for AD was comparable in MMSE, ADL, and ADAS-cog scores compared with the control group treated with single conventional drugs. Conclusion: Compared to single conventional drugs, the combination of PT and AT may be used as an alternative therapy to improve global cognition and functioning in AD, and the combination of PT and AT as adjunctive therapy appears to produce a better therapeutic response to AD in terms of efficacy without increasing the risk of adverse events. However, the very low to low quality of available evidence limits confidence in the findings. Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42023444156.",

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) holds promising potential in AD treatment, exemplified by Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a TCM formulation. The precise therapeutic mechanisms of DSS in AD remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to uncover the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of DSS in AD, employing an integrative approach encompassing gut microbiota and metabolomic analyses. Methods: Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were allocated into three groups: Blank Control (Con), AD Model (M), and Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS). AD models were established via bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of streptozotocin (STZ). DSS was orally administered at 24\u00a0g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1 (weight of raw herbal materials) for 14 days. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. Pathological alterations were assessed through hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Bloodstream metabolites were characterized, gut microbiota profiled through 16S rDNA sequencing, and cortical metabolomics analyzed. Hippocampal proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) were quantified using RT-qPCR, and oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, MDA) in brain tissues were measured with biochemical assays. Results: DSS identified a total of 1,625 bloodstream metabolites, predominantly Benzene derivatives, Carboxylic acids, and Fatty Acyls. DSS significantly improved learning and spatial memory in AD rats and ameliorated cerebral tissue pathology. The formulation enriched the probiotic Ligilactobacillus, modulating metabolites like Ophthalmic acid (OA), Phosphocreatine (PCr), Azacridone A, Inosine, and NAD. DSS regulated Purine and Nicotinate-nicotinamide metabolism, restoring balance in the Candidatus Saccharibacteria-OA interplay and stabilizing gut microbiota-metabolite homeostasis. Additionally, DSS reduced hippocampal IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 expression, attenuating the inflammatory state. It elevated antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX) while reducing MDA levels, indicating diminished oxidative stress in AD rat brains. Conclusion: DSS addresses AD pathology through multifaceted mechanisms, encompassing gut microbiome regulation, specific metabolite modulation, and the mitigation of inflammation and oxidative stress within the brain. This holistic intervention through the Microbial-Gut-Brain Axis (MGBA) underscores DSS's potential as an integrative therapeutic agent in combatting AD.",

The binding affinity of various divalent metal ions such as Cu and Zn present in AD-affected brain with different amino acids available in A\u03b2-peptide became the focus to explore their role in soluble neurotoxic oligomer formation. Cu2+ metal ions are known to enhance the neurotoxicity of the A\u03b21-42 peptide by catalyzing the formation of soluble neurotoxic oligomers. The competitive preference of both Cu2+ and Zn2+ simultaneously to interact with the A\u03b2-peptide is unknown. The divalent Cu and Zn ions were inserted in explicit aqueous A\u03b21-42 peptide configurations to get insights into the binding competence of these metal ions with peptides using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The metal-ion interactions reveal that competitive binding preferences of various peptide sites become metal-ion-specific and differ significantly. For Cu2+, interactions are found to be more significant with respect to those of Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-14. Asp-1, Glu-3, Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-13 amino acid residues show higher affinity toward Zn2+ ions. MD simulations show notable variation in the solvent-accessible surface area in the hydrophobic region of the peptide. Infinitesimal mobility was obtained for Zn2+ compared to Cu2+ in an aqueous solution and Cu2+ diffusivity deviated significantly at different time scales, proving its labile features in aqueous A\u03b21-42 peptides.",

Classification by conceptual-semantic impairment may be more informative. This study examined the effects of conceptual-semantic impairment and diagnostic subtype on anomia treatment effects in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). At baseline, the picture and word versions of the Pyramids and Palm Trees and Kissing and Dancing tests were used to measure conceptual-semantic processing. Based on norming that was conducted with unimpaired older adults, participants were classified as being impaired on both the picture and word versions (i.e., modality-general conceptual-semantic impairment), the picture version (Objects or Actions) only (i.e., visual-conceptual impairment), the word version (Nouns or Verbs) only (i.e., lexical-semantic impairment), or neither the picture nor the word version (i.e., no impairment). Following baseline testing, a lexical treatment and a semantic treatment were administered to all participants. The treatment stimuli consisted of nouns and verbs that were consistently named correctly at baseline (Prophylaxis items) and/or nouns and verbs that were consistently named incorrectly at baseline (Remediation items). Naming accuracy was measured at baseline, and it was measured at three, seven, eleven, fourteen, eighteen, and twenty-one months. Compared to baseline naming performance, lexical and semantic treatments both improved naming accuracy for treated Remediation nouns and verbs. For Prophylaxis items, lexical treatment was effective for both nouns and verbs, and semantic treatment was effective for verbs, but the pattern of results was different for nouns -- the effect of semantic treatment was initially nonsignificant or marginally significant, but it was significant beginning at 11 Months, suggesting that the effects of prophylactic semantic treatment may become more apparent as the disorder progresses. Furthermore, the interaction between baseline Conceptual-Semantic Impairment and the Treatment Condition (Lexical vs. Semantic) was significant for verb Prophylaxis items at 3 and 18 Months, and it was significant for noun Prophylaxis items at 14 and 18 Months. The pattern of results suggested that individuals who have modality-general conceptual-semantic impairment at baseline are more likely to benefit from lexical treatment, while individuals who have unimpaired conceptual-semantic processing at baseline are more likely to benefit from semantic treatment as the disorder progresses. In contrast to conceptual-semantic impairment, diagnostic subtype did not typically predict the treatment effects.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) shows promise in improving cognitive ability and brain glucose metabolism in AD, but its effects on peripheral and central metabolism are unclear. In this study, SAMP8 mice (AD model) received EA stimulation at specific acupoints. Cognitive abilities were evaluated using the Morris water maze test, while neuronal morphology and tau pathology were assessed through Nissl staining and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Metabolic variations and BAT thermogenesis were measured using ELISA, HE staining, Western blotting, and infrared thermal imaging. Compared to SAMR1 mice, SAMP8 mice showed impaired cognitive ability, neuronal damage, disrupted thermoregulation, and metabolic disorders with low BAT activity. Both the EA and DD groups improved cognitive ability and decreased tau phosphorylation (p<0.01 or p<0.05). However, only the EA group had a significant effect on metabolic disorders and BAT thermogenesis (p<0.01 or p<0.05), while the DD group did not. These findings indicate that EA not only improves the cognitive ability of SAMP8 mice, but also effectively regulates peripheral and central metabolic disorders, with this effect being significantly related to the activation of BAT thermogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "The design of multi-center study is increasingly used for borrowing strength from multiple research groups to obtain broadly applicable and reproducible study findings. Regression analysis is widely used for analyzing multi-group studies, however, some of the large number of regression predictors are nonlinear and/or often measured with batch effects in many large scale collaborative studies. Also, the group compositions of the nonlinear predictors are potentially heterogeneous across different centers. The conventional pooled data analysis ignores the interplay between nonlinearity and batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, measurement error and other data incoherence in multi-center setting that can cause biased regression estimates and misleading outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated partially linear regression model (IPLM) based analysis to account for the predictor's nonlinearity, general batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, high-dimensional covariates, potential measurement-error in covariates, and combinations of these complexities simultaneously. A local linear regression based approach is employed to estimate the nonlinear component and a regularization procedure is introduced to identify the predictors' effects that can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous across groups. In particular, when the effects of all predictors are homogeneous across the study centers, the proposed IPLM can automatically reduce to one single parsimonious partially linear model for all centers. The proposed method has asymptotic estimation and variable selection consistency including high-dimensional covariates. Moreover, it has a fast computing algorithm and its effectiveness is supported by numerical simulation studies. A multi-center Alzheimer's disease research project is provided to illustrate the proposed IPLM based analysis.",

Clinical trials play an essential role in developing and testing new treatments for AD. However, identifying eligible participants can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. In recent years, the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN), have helped to automate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the eligibility criteria (EC) more efficiently, in order to facilitate semi-automatic patient recruitment and enable data FAIRness for clinical trial data. Nevertheless, most current biomedical NER models only provide annotations for a restricted set of entity types that may not be applicable to the clinical trial data. Additionally, accurately performing NEN on entities that are negated using a negative prefix currently lacks established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed for information extraction from AD clinical trial EC, which involves preprocessing of the EC data, clinical NER, and biomedical NEN to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our NER model can identify named entities in seven pre-defined categories, while our NEN model employs a combination of exact match and partial match search strategies, as well as customized rules to accurately normalize entities with negative prefixes. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline, we measured the precision, recall, and F1 score for the NER component, and we manually reviewed the top five mapping results produced by the NEN component. Our evaluation of the pipeline's performance revealed that it can successfully normalize named entities in clinical trial ECs with optimal accuracies.

        "AbstractText": "The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are present in urban children exposed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), combustion and friction ultrafine PM (UFPM), and industrial nanoparticles (NPs). Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) forensic autopsies strongly suggest that anthropogenic UFPM and industrial NPs reach the brain through the nasal/olfactory, lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and placental barriers. Diesel-heavy unregulated vehicles are a key UFPM source for 21.8 million MMC residents. We found that hyperphosphorylated tau, beta amyloid1-42, \u03b1-synuclein, and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 were associated with NPs in 186 forensic autopsies (mean age 27.45\u2009\u00b1\u200911.89\u2009years). The neurovascular unit is an early NPs anatomical target, and the first two decades of life are critical: 100% of 57 children aged 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u2009years had AD pathology; 25 (43.9%) AD+TDP-43; 11 (19.3%) AD + PD\u2009+\u2009TDP-43; and 2 (3.56%) AD +PD. Fe, Ti, Hg, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, Al, Mg, Ag, Ce, La, Pr, W, Ca, Cl, K, Si, S, Na, and C NPs are seen in frontal and temporal lobes, olfactory bulb, caudate, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, medulla, cerebellum, and/or motor cortical and spinal regions. Endothelial, neuronal, and glial damages are extensive, with NPs in mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Autophagy, cell and nuclear membrane damage, disruption of nuclear pores and heterochromatin, and cell death are present. Metals associated with abrasion and deterioration of automobile catalysts and electronic waste and rare earth elements, i.e., lanthanum, cerium, and praseodymium, are entering young brains. Exposure to environmental UFPM and industrial NPs in the first two decades of life are prime candidates for initiating the early stages of fatal neurodegenerative diseases. MMC children and young adults-surrogates for children in polluted areas around the world-exhibit early AD, PD, FTLD, and ALS neuropathological hallmarks forecasting serious health, social, economic, academic, and judicial societal detrimental impact. Neurodegeneration prevention should be a public health priority as the problem of human exposure to particle pollution is solvable. We are knowledgeable of the main emission sources and the technological options to control them. What are we waiting for?",

        "AbstractText": "While the concept of cognitive resilience is well-established it has not been defined in a way that can be measured. This has been an impediment to studying its underlying biology and to developing instruments for its clinical assessment. This perspective highlights recent work that has quantified the expression of cortical proteins associated with cognitive resilience, thus facilitating studies of its complex underlying biology and the full range of its clinical effects in aging adults. These initial studies provide empirical support for the conceptualization of resilience as a continuum. Like other conventional risk factors, some individuals manifest higher-than-average cognitive resilience and other individuals manifest lower-than-average cognitive resilience. These novel approaches for advancing studies of cognitive resilience can be generalized to other aging phenotypes and can set the stage for the development of clinical tools that might have the potential to measure other mechanisms of resilience in aging adults. These advances also have the potential to catalyze a complementary therapeutic approach that focuses on augmenting resilience via lifestyle changes or therapies targeting its underlying molecular mechanisms to maintain cognition and brain health even in the presence of untreatable stressors like brain pathologies that accumulate in aging adults.",

        "AbstractText": "The incidence and mortality rates of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are gradually increasing worldwide. Numerous studies have demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. Ifenprodil, a subtype-selective NMDAR antagonist, showed strong therapeutic potential. However, it suffers from low oral bioavailability and off-target side effects. In this study, natural compounds were identified for selective inhibition of GluN1/GluN2B NMDAR of human. We obtained a set of natural compounds (n = 81,366) from COCONUT, TIPdb, PAMDB, CMNPD, YMDB, and NPAtlas databases, and then virtually screened by an ifenprodil-structure-based pharmacophore model and molecular docking. The top 100 compounds were selected for binding affinity prediction via batch drug-target affinity (BatchDTA). Then, the top 50 compounds were analyzed by absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET). Molecular dynamics involving molecular mechanics/position-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculation were performed to further screening. The top 15 compounds with strong binding affinity and ifenprodil, a proven GluN2B-selective NMDAR antagonist, were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns), root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), H-bonds, solvent accessible surface area (SASA), principal component analysis (PCA), and binding free energy calculations. Based on these analyses, one possible lead compound carrying positive charges (CNP0099440) was identified, with great binding affinity and less off-target activity by contrast to ifenprodil. CNP0099440 has great potential to be a GluN1/GluN2B NMDAR antagonist candidate and can be further detected via in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

In order to investigate the regulatory effect of ICA on the expression level of AD pathological phosphorylation regulatory proteins, this study further explored the possible molecular mechanism of ICA regulating AD autophagy through network pharmacology. Macromolecular docking network was verified by Autodock Vina 1.1.2 software. The main active ingredients of ICA, the physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic information of ICA were predicted using online databases and relevant information. The results showed that the targets of MAPK3, AKT1, HSP90AA1, ESR1, and HSP90AA1 were more critical in the treatment of AD. Autophagy, apoptosis, senescence factors, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (P13K/AKT) signaling pathway, MAKP, mTOR, and other pathways were significantly associated with AD. Docking of ICA with HIF-1, BNIP3, PINK1, and Parkin pathway molecules showed that the key targets of the signaling pathway were more stably bound to ICA, which may provide a better pathway for ICA to regulate autophagy by providing a better pathway. ICA can improve AD, and its mechanism may be related to the P13K/AKT, MAKP, and mTOR signaling pathways, thereby regulating autophagy-related proteins.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While multiple theories explaining the aetiology of the disease have been suggested, the underlying cause of the disease is still unknown. Despite this, several modifiable and non-modifiable factors that increase the risk of developing AD have been identified. To date, only eight AD drugs have ever gained regulatory approval, including six symptomatic and two disease-modifying drugs. However, not all are available in all countries and high costs associated with new disease-modifying biologics prevent large proportions of the patient population from accessing them. With the current patient population expected to triple by 2050, it is imperative that new, effective, and affordable drugs become available to patients. Traditional drug development strategies have a 99% failure rate in AD, which is far higher than in other disease areas. Even when a drug does reach the market, additional barriers such as high cost and lack of accessibility prevent patients from benefiting from them. In this review, we discuss how a stratified medicine drug repurposing approach may address some of the limitations and barriers that traditional strategies face in relation to drug development in AD. We believe that novel, stratified drug repurposing studies may expedite the discovery of alternative, effective, and more affordable treatment options for a rapidly expanding patient population in comparison with traditional drug development methods.",

Deposits of the small toxic peptide beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) cause the formation of extracellular plaques and accumulate in vessels disrupting the blood flow but may also play a role in blood clotting. In the present study, we aim to explore the impact of A\u03b2 on the migration of endothelial cells and subsequent vessel formation. We use organotypic brain slices of postnatal day 10 wildtype mice (C57BL/6) and connect them to small microcontact prints (\u00b5CPs) of collagen. Our data show that laminin-positive endothelial cells migrate onto collagen \u00b5CPs, but without any vessel formation after 4 weeks. When the \u00b5CPs are loaded with human A\u03b240, (aggregated) human A\u03b242 and mouse A\u03b242 peptides, the number and migration distance of endothelial cells are significantly reduced, but with a more pronounced subsequent vessel formation. The vessel formation is verified by zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and -2 stainings and confocal microscopy. In addition, the vessel formation is accompanied by a stronger GFAP-positive astroglial formation. Finally, we show that vessels can grow towards convergence when two opposed slices are connected via microcontact-printed lanes. In conclusion, our data show that A\u03b2 promotes vessel formation, and organotypic brain slices connected to collagen \u00b5CPs provide a potent tool to study vessel formation.",

        "AbstractText": "A major contributor to dementia seen in aging is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (A\u03b2), a main component of senile plaques (SPs) in AD, induces neuronal death through damage to cellular organelles and structures, caused by oxidation of important molecules such as proteins by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of the protein tau in the microtubules within the brain also promote ROS production. Methionine, a residue of proteins, is particularly sensitive to oxidation by ROS. One of the enzyme systems that reverses the oxidative damage in mammalian cells is the enzyme system known as Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases (MSRs). The components of the MSR system, namely MSRA and MSRB, reduce oxidized forms of methionine (Met-(o)) in proteins back to methionine (Met). Furthermore, the MSRs scavenge ROS by allowing methionine residues in proteins to utilize their antioxidant properties. This review aims to improve the understanding of the role of the MSR system of enzymes in reducing cellular oxidative damage and AD pathogenesis, which may contribute to effective therapeutic approaches for AD by targeting the MSR system.",

Among the NDs, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread disease, which affects more than 400 million people globally. Oxidative stress is evident in the pathophysiology of nearly all NDs by affecting several pathways in neurodegeneration. No single drug can manage multi-faceted diseases like NDs. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy is required, which can affect several pathophysiological pathways at a time. To achieve this aim, hexane and ethyl acetate extract from Trachyspermum ammi (Carom) were prepared, and GC/MS identified the bioactive compounds. For the cell-based assays, oxidative stress was induced in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using hydrogen peroxide to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the Carom extracts/bioactives. The extracts/bioactives provided neuroprotection in the cells by modulating multiple pathways involved in neurodegeneration, such as alleviating oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential. They were potent inhibitors of acetylcholine esterase enzymes and displayed competitive/mixed-type inhibition. Additionally, anti-A\u03b21-42 fibrilization/oligomerization and anti-glycation activities were also analyzed. The multi-faceted neuroprotection shown via Carom/Carvacrol makes it a prospective contender in drug development for NDs.",

In this study, we investigated SENP1 and SUMOylation changes in the brains of aged APOE3 and APOE4 mice, aiming to understand their potential impact on mitochondrial metabolism and their contribution to cellular senescence in APOE4 mice. Concurrently, SUMO1-conjugated protein levels decreased, while SUMO2/3-conjugated protein levels increased relatively with the aging of APOE4 mice. This suggests that the equilibrium between the SUMOylation and deSUMOylation processes may be associated with senescence and longevity.

        "AbstractText": "Natively unfolded tau has a low propensity to form aggregates, but in tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Multiple intracellular transport pathways utilize kinesin-1, a plus-end-directed microtubule-based motor. Kinesin-1 is crucial in various neurodegenerative diseases as it transports multiple cargoes along the microtubules (MT). Kinesin-1 proteins cannot progress along MTs due to an accumulation of tau on their surfaces. Although kinesin-1-mediated neuronal transport dysfunction is well-documented in other neurodegenerative diseases, its role in AD has received less attention. Very recently, we have shown that knocking down and knocking out of kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B KO) expression significantly reduced the level and stability of tau in cells and tau transgenic mice, respectively. Here, we report that tau interacts with the motor domain of KIF5B in vivo and in vitro, possibly through its microtubule-binding repeat domain. This interaction leads to the inhibition of the ATPase activity of the motor domain. In addition, the KIF5B KO results in autophagy initiation, which subsequently assists in tau degradation. The mechanisms behind KIF5B KO-mediated tau degradation seem to involve its interaction with tau, promoting the trafficking of tau through retrograde transport into autophagosomes for subsequent lysosomal degradation of tau. Our results suggest how KIF5B removal facilitates the movement of autophagosomes toward lysosomes for efficient tau degradation. This mechanism can be enabled through the downregulation of kinesin-1 or the disruption of the association between kinesin-1 and tau, particularly in cases when neurons perceive disturbances in intercellular axonal transport.",

Luminex technology was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 across three decades, while immunohistochemistry was used to examine A\u03b2 plaque density in the amygdala. A\u03b240 was found to be the predominant isoform of A\u03b2 in the CSF, but neither A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 concentrations showed an age-related change, and the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 showed only a marginal increase.

The results demonstrate that HRT involving estrogen can reduce A\u03b2 plaque load in a cognitive brain region of aged non-human primates.

African Americans are twice as likely to develop dementia than other ethnic populations. Traditional cognitive screening solutions lack the sensitivity to independently identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. The DCTclock is a 3-min AI-enabled adaptation of the well-established clock drawing test. The DCTclock can estimate dementia risk for both general cognitive impairment and the presence of AD pathology. Here we performed a retrospective analysis to assess the performance of the DCTclock to estimate future conversion to ADRD in African American participants from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and African American Clinical Core (AACORE). We assessed baseline DCTclock scores in 646 participants (baseline median age = 78.0 \u00b1 6.4, median years of education = 14.0 \u00b1 3.2, 78% female) and found significantly lower baseline DCTclock scores in those who received a dementia diagnosis within 3 years. We also found that 16.4% of participants with a baseline DCTclock score less than 60 were significantly more likely to develop dementia in 5 years vs. those with the highest DCTclock scores (75-100). This research demonstrates the DCTclock's ability to estimate the 5-year risk of developing dementia in an African American population. Early detection of elevated dementia risk using the DCTclock could provide patients, caregivers, and clinicians opportunities to plan and intervene early to improve cognitive health trajectories.

Patients with recurrent seizures often present with cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear how seizures, even when infrequent, produce long-lasting deficits in cognition. One mechanism may be seizure-induced expression of \u0394FosB, a long-lived transcription factor that persistently regulates expression of plasticity-related genes and drives cognitive dysfunction. We previously found that, compared with cognitively-intact subjects, the activity-dependent expression of \u0394FosB in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was increased in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in individuals with AD. In MCI patients, higher \u0394FosB expression corresponded to lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Surgically resected DG tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy also showed robust \u0394FosB expression; however, it is unclear whether \u0394FosB expression also corresponds to cognitive dysfunction in non-AD-related epilepsy. To test whether DG \u0394FosB expression is indicative of cognitive impairment in epilepsies with different etiologies, we assessed \u0394FosB expression in surgically-resected hippocampal tissue from 33 patients with childhood epilepsies who had undergone Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) testing prior to surgery. We found that \u0394FosB expression is inversely correlated with Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) in patients with mild to severe intellectual disability (FSIQ < 85).

We identified studies that focus on written discourse performance in people with aphasia, primary progressive aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies were identified from the review of literature, some of which addressed more than one of our review questions. Fifteen studies included a comparison between clinical populations and controls. Six studies compared different characteristics of patient populations. Three studies reported changes over time in progressive disorders. Six studies targeted different modalities of discourse. Differences in linguistic features by patient populations are not yet clear due to the limited number of studies and different measures and tasks used across the studies. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of numerous linguistic features in acquired neurogenic communication disorders that depart from those of healthy controls. Compared to the controls, people with aphasia tend to produce fewer words, and syntactically simpler utterances compared to the controls. People with Alzheimer's disease produce less information content, and this feature increases over time, as reported in longitudinal studies.

Understanding torsade de pointes (TdP)/QT prolongation with different ChEIs is essential for its safe and rational administration. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between different ChEIs and TdP/QT prolongation. Methods: All ChEIs related TdP/QT prolongation cases were retrieved from the FAERS database using standard MedDRA query (SMQ) from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2022. Disproportionality and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the signal of TdP/QT prolongation related to ChEIs. Results: 557 cases of TdP/QT prolongation related to 3 ChEIs were searched by SMQ. The patients were mostly elderly people, with markedly more female than male. The signals of TdP/QT prolongation for ChEIs were detected by disproportionality analysis, and the signal of Donepezil was the strongest. The sensitivity analysis results indicate a robust and stable correlation between these signals with ChEIs. TdP/QT prolongation usually occurs within 1\u00a0month after taking ChEIs. The drug with the highest frequency of combination with donepezil and galantamine is citalopram, and the drug with the highest frequency of combination with rivastigmine is atorvastatin. Conclusion: The signals of TdP/QT prolongation related to ChEIs were strong and stable. It is necessary to be vigilant about the TdP/QT prolongation of various ChEIs, especially in elderly women, the initial stage after taking ChEIs, and when ChEIs combining with drugs that could prolong the QT interval.",

A qualitative study comprised of semi-structured interviews via web conferencing software. Thematic analysis was undertaken, with themes/subthemes derived and a qualitative framework generated. Three Victorian Universities in Australia. Physiotherapy students of entry-to-professional practice education programs (n\u202f=\u202f17; mean age 23.7 years, 65% female), having completed at least 15 weeks of clinical placements. The overarching theme was that students' experience of providing care for people with dementia was variable. The three sub-themes were: 1) students experience significant challenges when working with people with dementia, 2) students experience a range of emotions when working with people with dementia, and 3) the quality of dementia learning experiences during entry-to-professional practice training is mostly inadequate. Students described the importance of the supervisor during clinical placements, and suggested incorporating 'real-life' scenario training in the classroom to assist them learn to manage the challenging symptoms of dementia. Physiotherapy students believe that entry-to-practice dementia education is insufficient. These findings have important implications for the future planning and delivery of physiotherapy dementia education. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER.",

This study looked at newly synthesized isoindole derivatives and their effects on SH-SY5Y as a neuroblastoma cell under oxidative stress through the NRF2 signaling pathway. NRF2 transcription factor plays a vital role in the oxidative stress response and cellular homeostasis. Three isoindoline-dione derivatives were synthesized by reacting phthalic anhydrides with 4-(2-aminoethyl)-1-benzyl piperidine. Their structures were confirmed through FT-IR, NMR, and Mass spectroscopy. The derivatives were then tested on human SH-SY5Y cells under an oxidative stress model induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The cell viability, ROS levels, protein carbonyl content, and gene expression of NRF2 and phase II antioxidative enzymes were measured after 24\u2009h. Three isoindoline derivatives (3a-3c) were observed to increase the viability of SH-SY5Y cells by protective against oxidative stress, reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species and carbonylated proteins, and increasing gene expression levels of NRF2 and associated genes such as NQO-1, and GSTK1. Isoindoline derivatives demonstrated a neuroprotective effect on SH-SY5Y cells through various neuroprotective mechanisms, although more studies are needed.",

        "AbstractText": "Intramembrane proteases (IPs) hydrolyze peptides in the lipid membrane. IPs participate in a number of cellular pathways including immune response and surveillance, and cholesterol biosynthesis, and they are exploited by viruses for replication. Despite their broad importance across biology, how activity is regulated in the cell to control protein maturation and release of specific bioactive peptides at the right place and right time remains largely unanswered, particularly for the intramembrane aspartyl protease (IAP) subtype. At a molecular biochemical level, different IAP homologs can cleave non-biological substrates, and there is no sequence recognition motif among the nearly 150 substrates identified for just one IAP, presenilin-1, the catalytic component of \u03b3-secretase known for its involvement in the production of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques associated with Alzheimer disease. Here we used gel-based assays combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and FRET-based kinetics assays to probe the cleavage profile of the presenilin homolog from the methanogen Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1 as a function of the surrounding lipid-mimicking environment, either detergent micelles or bicelles. We selected four biological IAP substrates that have not undergone extensive cleavage profiling previously, namely, the viral core protein of Hepatitis C virus, the viral core protein of Classical Swine Fever virus, the transmembrane segment of Notch-1, and the tyrosine receptor kinase ErbB4. Our study demonstrates a proclivity toward cleavage of substrates at positions of low average hydrophobicity and a consistent role for the lipid environment in modulating kinetic properties.",

        "AbstractText": "Polyphenols are natural compounds abundantly found in plants. They are known for their numerous benefits to human health, including antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory activities. Interestingly, many studies have revealed that polyphenols can also modulate the formation of amyloid fibrils associated with disease states and can prevent the formation of cytotoxic oligomer species. In this review, we underline the numerous effects of four hydrolysable gallotannins (HGTs) with high conformational flexibility, low toxicity, and multi-targeticity, e.g., tannic acid, pentagalloyl glucose, corilagin, and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucose, on the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins associated with the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These HGTs have demonstrated interesting abilities to reduce, at different levels, the formation of amyloid fibrils involved in AD, including those assembled from the amyloid \u03b2-peptide, the tubulin-associated unit, and the islet amyloid polypeptide. HGTs were also shown to disassemble pre-formed fibrils and to diminish cognitive decline in mice. Finally, this manuscript highlights the importance of further investigating these naturally occurring HGTs as promising scaffolds to design molecules that can interfere with the formation of proteotoxic oligomers and aggregates associated with AD pathogenesis.",

A single-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled intervention study was proposed to compare immediate well-being measured by a visual analog scale (EVIBE) as primary outcome between the intervention group (AAT combined with cognitive stimulation) and the control group (cognitive stimulation only) in AD patients. Secondary outcomes were explored, such as well-being after intervention (also with the EVIBE), cognitive performance (measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive part GRECO version), behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Behavioral Scale-Nursing Home Version), current depressive symptomatology (with the 30 items Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS 30]) and anxiety (by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).

BPSD often leads to complications for patients (hospitalization, institutionalization). Caregivers are often family members, and it may be difficult for them to manage the disruptive behavior or apathy of their loved ones. This situation often generates physical and psychological symptoms. The Nice University Hospital (France) and the Bien Vieillir Nice 2030 project offer at-home non-pharmacological therapies to reduce BPSD, combined with psychoeducational sessions to improve caregiver skills. A team of psychologists went to the patients' homes 3 times per week to provide personalized non-pharmacological therapies for the patients and educational programs for their caregivers. The monocentric feasibility study was carried out among 20 patient-caregiver pairs (over 7 months). Cohen-Mansfield Inventory Scales, Zarit Burden Interviews, Caregiver Reaction Inventories, and Dementia Quality of life interviews were performed during the study. The Mederic Alzheimer Foundation (MAF) conducted an external evaluation of the project. Analysis of the results showed a significant reduction (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00,05) in the number of BPSD on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00,034). As well as a significant reduction in the behavioral symptoms of agitation on the CMAI scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00,041). A non-significant reduction in caregiver burden was also noted. Even if the results are encouraging, it is essential to conduct a medico-economic analysis to validate the feasibility of the PsyDoMa model. More clinical studies are needed to conclude.",

        "AbstractText": "We examined associations between intra-generational social mobility (reflected in life-course socioeconomic trajectories) and mortality, among older men. Data came from a prospective Australian community-based cohort of older men. Social mobility was defined by socioeconomic indicators from three points in the life-course: educational attainment (late adolescence-early adulthood), occupation (mid-life), and current sources of income (older age). We defined indicators of social mobility trajectory (6 categories; reflecting the direction of social mobility) and social mobility status (2 categories; mobile or non-mobile). We used Cox regression to examine associations with mortality, adjusting for age, country of birth, and living arrangement. We followed 1568 men (mean age 76.8, SD 5.4) for a mean duration of 9.1 years, with 797 deaths recorded. Moving upward was the predominant social mobility trajectory (36.0%), followed by mixed trajectories (25.1%), downward (15.1%), stable low (12.2%), stable high (7.6%), and stable middle (4.0%). Men with downward (Hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.19) and stable low socioeconomic trajectories (1.77, 1.25 to 2.50) had higher mortality risks than men with stable high socioeconomic trajectories, while men with upward trajectories had similar risks to those with stable high trajectories. 76.2% of the participants were classified as having mobile status; no associations were evident between binary social mobility status and mortality. These findings suggest cumulative and persistent exposure to disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions across the life-course, rather than social mobility, is associated with increased mortality. For each stage of the life-course, addressing socioeconomic disadvantage may reduce inequities in mortality.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia and poses a serious threat to the health of the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) presents as a promising novel therapeutic therapy for preventing and treating dementia. Studies have shown that natural products derived from kidney-tonifying herbs can effectively inhibit AD. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor in the pathology of AD. Regulation of ER stress is a crucial approach to prevent and treat AD. Thus, in this study, we first collected kidney-tonifying herbs, integrated chemical ingredients from multiple TCM databases, and constructed a comprehensive drug-target network. Subsequently, we employed the endophenotype network (network proximity) method to identify potential active ingredients in kidney-tonifying herbs that prevented AD via regulating ER stress. By combining the predicted outcomes, we discovered that 32 natural products could ameliorate AD pathology via regulating ER stress. After a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-network model and systematic pharmacological analyses, we further selected several promising compounds for in vitro testing in the APP-SH-SY5Y cell model. Experimental results showed that echinacoside and danthron were able to effectively reduce ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the expression levels of BIP, p-PERK, ATF6, and CHOP in APP-SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, this study utilized the endophenotype network to preliminarily decipher the effective material basis and potential molecular mechanism of kidney-tonifying Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical phase. Although late-stage AD/dementia may be robustly differentiated from cognitively normal individuals by means of a clinical evaluation, PET imaging, and established biofluid biomarkers, disease differentiation between cognitively normal and various subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a challenging task. Differential biomarkers for early-stage AD diagnosis with accessible biofluid samples are urgently needed. Misfolded phosphorylated tau aggregates (p-tau) are present in multiple neurodegenerative diseases known as \"tauopathies\", with the most common being AD. P-tau181 is a well-established p-tau biomarker to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD pathology. However, it is unclear if p-tau181 is capable of diagnosing MCI, an early AD stage, from cognitively normal subjects, or if it can discriminate MCI subtypes amnestic MCI (aMCI) from non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Here we evaluated the capability of p-tau181 in diagnosing MCI from cognitively normal subjects and discriminating aMCI from naMCI subtypes. We collected matching plasma and CSF samples of a clinically diagnosed cohort of 35 cognitively normal, 34 aMCI, 17 naMCI, and 31 AD dementia cases (total 117 participants) with supplemental CSF A\u03b242 and total tau AD biomarker levels and performed Simoa p-tau181 assays. The diagnostic capabilities of Simoa p-tau181 assays to differentiate these cohorts were evaluated. We found (i) p-tau181 can robustly differentiate MCI or aMCI from cognitively normal cohorts with matching plasma and CSF samples, but such differentiation is weaker in diagnosing naMCI from cognitively normal groups, (ii) p-tau181 is not capable of differentiating aMCI from naMCI cohorts, and (iii) either factor of A\u03b2 or total tau burden markedly improved differentiation power to diagnose aMCI from cognitively normal group. Plasma and CSF p-tau181 levels may serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosing aMCI from normal controls in the preclinical phase. But more robust new biomarkers are needed to differentiate naMCI from cognitively normal cases or to discriminate between MCI subtypes, aMCI from naMCI.",

On the other hand, Artificial intelligence (AI) helps genome editing achieve more precision, efficiency, and affordability in tackling various diseases, like Sickle cell anemia or Thalassemia. AI models have been in use for designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas systems. Tools like DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and DeepHF have the capability to predict optimal guide RNAs (gRNAs) for a specified target sequence. These predictions take into account multiple factors, including genomic context, Cas protein type, desired mutation type, on-target/off-target scores, potential off-target sites, and the potential impacts of genome editing on gene function and cell phenotype. These models aid in optimizing different genome editing technologies, such as base, prime, and epigenome editing, which are advanced techniques to introduce precise and programmable changes to DNA sequences without relying on the homology-directed repair pathway or donor DNA templates. Furthermore, AI, in collaboration with genome editing and precision medicine, enables personalized treatments based on genetic profiles. AI analyzes patients' genomic data to identify mutations, variations, and biomarkers associated with different diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. However, several challenges persist, including high costs, off-target editing, suitable delivery methods for CRISPR cargoes, improving editing efficiency, and ensuring safety in clinical applications.

        "AbstractText": "Lysosomes primarily recognized as center for cellular 'garbage-disposing-unit', which has recently emerged as a crucial regulator of cellular metabolism. This organelle is a well-known vital player in the pathology including neurodegenerative disorders. In pathological context, removal of intracellular damaged misfolded proteins, organelles and aggregates are ensured by 'Autophagy' pathway, which initially recognizes, engulfs and seals the toxic cargo at the cytosolic environment. Thereafter the cell completes the task of encapsulated cargo elimination upon delivery of them to the terminal compartment - lysosome, which contains acid hydrolases, that are capable of degrading the abnormal protein-lipid-repertoire. The merge between inseparable 'Autophagy' and 'Lysosomal' pathways evolved into 'Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway (ALP)', through which cell ultimately degrades and recycles bio-materials for metabolic needs. Dysregulation of any of the steps of the multi-step ALP can contribute to the development and progression of disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, targeting differential steps of ALP or directly lysosomes using nano-bioengineering approaches holds great promise for therapeutic interventions. This review aims to explore the role of distal autophagy pathway and proximal lysosomal function, as cellular degradative and metabolic hubs, in healing neurological disorders and highlights the contributions of nano-bioengineering in this field. Despite multiple challenges, this review underscores the immense potential of integrating autophagy-lysosomal biology with nano-bioengineering to revolutionize the field and provide novel therapeutic avenues for tackling neurological-neurodegenerative-disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "The high prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is an unintended consequence of the high longevity of the population, together with the lack of effective preventive and therapeutic options. There is great pressure on preclinical research, and both old and new models of neurodegenerative diseases are required to increase the pipeline of new drugs for clinical testing. We review here the main models of neurotoxicity-based animal models leading to central neurodegeneration. Our main focus was on studying how changes in neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, mainly in rodent models, contribute to harmful processes linked to neurodegeneration. The majority of the models currently in use mimic Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are the most common neurodegenerative conditions in older adults. AD is the most common age-related dementia, whereas PD is the most common movement disorder with also cases of dementia. Several natural toxins and xenobiotic agents induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration and can reproduce neuropathological traits of PD. The literature analysis of MPTP, 6-OH-dopamine, and rotenone models suggested the latter as a useful model when specific doses of rotenone were administrated systemically to C57BL/6 mice. Cholinergic neurodegeneration is mainly modelled with the toxin scopolamine, which is a useful rodent model for the screening of protective drugs against cognitive decline and AD. Several agents have been used to model neuroinflammation-based neurodegeneration and dementia in AD, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), streptozotocin, and monomeric C-reactive protein. The bacterial agent LPS makes a useful rodent model for testing anti-inflammatory therapies to halt the development and severity of AD. However, neurotoxin models might be more useful than genetic models for drug discovery in PD but that is not the case in AD where they cannot beat the new developments in transgenic mouse models. Overall, we should work using all available models, either in vivo, in vitro, or in silico, considering the seriousness of the moment and urgency of developing effective drugs.",

This study evaluated early hippocampal oxidative stress, pre- and post-synaptic proteins in intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) models of impaired insulin signaling. Adult male Wistar rats were injected with STZ, IP, or ICV, and sacrificed 1-, 3-, or 6-weeks post injection. Rat's cognitive behavior was assessed using Morris water maze (MWM) tests at weeks 3 and 6. Hippocampal synaptosomal fractions were examined for oxidative stress markers and presynaptic [synapsin I, synaptophysin, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25)] and postsynaptic [drebrin, synapse-associated protein-97 (SAP-97), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95)] proteins. IP-STZ and ICV-STZ treatment impaired rat's cognition, decreased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) in a time dependent manner. In addition, it reduced the expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. The decline in cognition is significantly correlated with the reduction in synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. In conclusion, impaired insulin signaling in the brain is deleterious in causing early synaptosomal oxidative damage and synaptic loss that exacerbates with time and correlates with cognitive impairments. Our data implicates oxidative stress and synaptic protein loss as an early feature of sAD and provides insights into early biochemical and behavioral changes during disease progression.",

In this study, a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model was utilized to capture differences in neurocognitive, genetic, and brain atrophy patterns that can predict cognitive status, ranging from Normal Cognition (NC) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Elucidating model predictions is vital in medical applications to promote clinical adoption and establish physician trust. Therefore, we introduce a decomposition-based explanation method for individual patient classification. Our method involves analyzing the output variations resulting from decomposing input values, which allows us to determine the degree of impact on the prediction. Through this process, we gain insight into how each feature from various modalities, both at the individual and group levels, contributes to the diagnostic result. Given that graph data contains critical information in edges, we studied relational data by silencing all the edges of a particular class, thereby obtaining explanations at the neighborhood level. Our functional evaluation showed that the explanations remain stable with minor changes in input values, specifically for edge weights exceeding 0.80. Additionally, our comparative analysis against SHAP values yielded comparable results with significantly reduced computational time. To further validate the model's explanations, we conducted a survey study with 11 domain experts. The majority (71%) of the responses confirmed the correctness of the explanations, with a rating of above six on a 10-point scale for the understandability of the explanations. Strategies to overcome perceived limitations, such as the GCN's overreliance on demographic information, were discussed to facilitate future adoption into clinical practice and gain clinicians' trust as a diagnostic decision support system.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the neuromuscular junction. PD and comorbid MG are rarely seen. Here we report on a patient who was diagnosed with PD and MG. A 74-year-old man had a 4-year history of bradykinesia and was diagnosed with PD. He subsequently developed incomplete palpebral ptosis, apparent dropped head, and shuffling of gait. The results of neostigmine tests were positive. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showed significant decremental responses at 3 and 5 Hz in the orbicularis oculi. The patient's anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AchR) antibody serum level was also elevated. Meanwhile, 9-[18F]fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-AV133 PET-CT) scan revealed a significant decrease in uptake in the bilateral putamen. After addition of cholinesterase inhibitors, his symptoms of palpebral ptosis and head drop improved greatly and he showed a good response to levodopa. Although PD with MG is rare, we still need to notice the possibility that a PD patient may have comorbid MG. The underlying mechanism of PD and comorbid MG remains unknown, but an imbalance between the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine and the immune system are likely to play significant roles in the pathogenesis. In this article, we present our case and a literature review on the co-occurrence of PD and MG, reviewing their clinical features, and discuss the underlying pathogenic mechanism of this comorbidity.",

        "AbstractText": "The cause(s) of lack of awareness of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases can be multifactorial. Yet neurologically oriented research on anosognosia of cognitive decline almost exclusively assumes that the underlying disturbance of neuro-networks that support various cognitive functions accounts for the reduced self-awareness. Cultural and psychosocial factors, including the person's emotional state, however, can contribute to the underreporting or avoidance of admitting to cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative diseases. Research on the causes of lack of awareness of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders needs to include these variables. We briefly present two case examples of underreporting or \"unawareness\" of memory difficulties in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (or minor neurocognitive disorder). One presented with classic anosognosia for memory impairment, while the other initially reported no memory impairment but later admitted to \"denying\" her memory difficulties secondary to anxiety. Based on these patients' clinical presentations and available research, we suggest three potential screening items that may help identify probable denial of memory impairments when studying anosognosia in MCI.",

Existing literature highlights the vulnerability of this group that is reflected by various somatic and mental health issues including cognitive dysfunctions. Although cognitive training studies in various target groups of older people have been conducted, there is lack of data regarding cognitive training in older prisoners. A structured cognitive group training program (\"NEUROvitalis Prison\") with 12 weekly sessions was offered to male prisoners in Germany. Post intervention an exploratory qualitative study was conducted. Prisoners (N\u2009=\u200918) and staff (N\u2009=\u20094) perspectives were explored by conducting face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Audiotaped data were fully transcribed and deductive-inductive content analyses applied. Both the prisoners and the staff perceived the cognitive training as very positive and stimulating. Moreover, the importance of the training was pronounced in terms of an increase in self-esteem and understanding of cognition and aging in the prisoners. Our data indicate that cognitive training may be a feasible and valuable intervention for older prisoners that will be appreciated by both inmates and staff. The qualitative data provide substantial insight into the experiences with the applied cognitive training program. Moreover, valuable modifications for future conduct can be derived.",

        "AbstractText": "In the last few years, several models trying to calculate the biological brain age have been proposed based on structural magnetic resonance imaging scans (T1-weighted MRIs, T1w) using multivariate methods and machine learning. We developed and validated a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based biological brain age prediction model that uses one T1w MRI preprocessing step when applying the model to external datasets to simplify implementation and increase accessibility in research settings. Our model only requires rigid image registration to the MNI space, which is an advantage compared to previous methods that require more preprocessing steps, such as feature extraction. We used a multicohort dataset of cognitively healthy individuals (age range\u2009=\u200932.0-95.7\u2009years) comprising 17,296 MRIs for training and evaluation. We compared our model using hold-out (CNN1) and cross-validation (CNN2-4) approaches. To verify generalisability, we used two external datasets with different populations and MRI scan characteristics to evaluate the model. To demonstrate its usability, we included the external dataset's images in the cross-validation training (CNN3). To ensure that our model used only the brain signal on the image, we also predicted brain age using skull-stripped images (CNN4). The trained models achieved a mean absolute error of 2.99, 2.67, 2.67, and 3.08\u2009years for CNN1-4, respectively. The model's performance in the external dataset was in the typical range of mean absolute error (MAE) found in the literature for testing sets. Adding the external dataset to the training set (CNN3), overall, MAE is unaffected, but individual cohort MAE improves (5.63-2.25\u2009years). Salience maps of predictions reveal that periventricular, temporal, and insular regions are the most important for age prediction. We provide indicators for using biological (predicted) brain age as a metric for age correction in neuroimaging studies as an alternative to the traditional chronological age. In conclusion, using different approaches, our CNN-based model showed good performance using one T1w brain MRI preprocessing step. The proposed CNN model is made publicly available for the research community to be easily implemented and used to study ageing and age-related disorders.",

To elucidate the interrelationship and its impact on outcomes, a comprehensive investigation was carried out utilising time-unrestricted searches of reputable databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of various medical conditions on severe COVID-19-related events. We focused on identifying and analysing articles that discussed the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, particularly those pertaining to severe events such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, pneumonia, mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen. Through careful data analysis and information gathering, we tried to figure out how likely it was that people with conditions, like AD, would have serious events. Our research investigated potential mechanisms that link AD and COVID-19. The ability of the virus to directly invade the central nervous system and the role of ACE-2 receptors were investigated. Furthermore, the OAS1 gene served as the genetic link between AD and COVID-19. In the context of COVID-19, our findings suggest that individuals with AD may be more susceptible to experiencing severe outcomes. Consequently, it is crucial to provide personalised care and management for this demographic. Further investigation is required to attain a comprehensive comprehension of the intricate correlation between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19, as well as its ramifications for patient outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The evaluation of pupillary light reflex (PLR) by chromatic pupillometry may provide a unique insight into specific photoreceptor functions. Chromatic pupillometry refers to evaluating PLR to different wavelengths and intensities of light in order to differentiate outer/inner retinal photoreceptor contributions to the PLR. Different protocols have been tested and are now established to assess in-vivo PLR contribution mediated by melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). These intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors modulate the non-image-forming functions of the eye, which are mainly the circadian photoentrainment and PLR, via projections to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic and olivary pretectal nucleus, respectively. In this context, chromatic pupillometry has been used as an alternative and non-invasive tool to evaluate the mRGC system in several clinical settings, including hereditary optic neuropathies, glaucoma, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this article is to review the key steps of chromatic pupillometry protocols for studying in-vivo mRGC-system functionality and provide the main findings of this technique in the research setting on neurodegeneration. mRGC-dependent pupillary responses are short-wavelength sensitive, have a higher threshold of activation, and are much slower and sustained compared with rod- and cone-mediated responses, driving the tonic component of the PLR during exposure to high-irradiance and continuous light stimulus. Thus, mRGCs contribute mainly to the tonic component of the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to bright blue light flash that persists after light stimulation is switched off. Given the role of mRGCs in circadian photoentrainment, the use of chromatic pupillometry to perform a functional evaluation of mRGcs may be proposed as an early biomarker of mRGC-dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders characterized by circadian and/or sleep dysfunction such as AD, PD, and its prodromal phase iRBD. The evaluation by chromatic pupillometry of mRGC-system functionality may lay the groundwork for a new, easily accessible biomarker that can be exploited also as the starting point for future longitudinal cohort studies aimed at stratifying the risk of conversion in these disorders.",

While the genetic cause of SMA has been well documented, the exact mechanism(s) by which SMN depletion results in disease progression remain elusive.

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation process which is necessary for cellular homeostasis; defects in the autophagic machinery have been linked with a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The pathway is particularly known to prevent neurodegeneration and has been suggested to act as a neuroprotective factor, thus presenting an attractive target for novel therapies for SMA patients. In this review, (a) we provide for the first time a comprehensive summary of the perturbations in the autophagic networks that characterize SMA development, (b) highlight the autophagic regulators which may play a key role in SMA pathogenesis and (c) propose decreased autophagic flux as the causative agent underlying the autophagic dysregulation observed in these patients.",

        "AbstractText": "The increasing life expectancy has led to a higher incidence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions. Within this framework, neuroinflammation emerges as a significant contributing factor. It involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). These instances result in neuronal damage and neurodegeneration through activated nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathways and decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity. Due to limited effectiveness regarding the inhibition of neuroinflammatory targets using conventional drugs, there is challenging growth in the search for innovative therapies for alleviating neuroinflammation in CNS diseases or even before their onset. Our results indicate that interventions focusing on Interleukin-Driven Immunomodulation, Chemokine (CXC) Receptor Signaling and Expression, Cold Exposure, and Fibrin-Targeted strategies significantly promise to mitigate neuroinflammatory processes. These approaches demonstrate potential anti-neuroinflammatory effects, addressing conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease. While the findings are promising, immunomodulatory therapies often face limitations due to Immune-Related Adverse Events. Therefore, the conduction of randomized clinical trials in this matter is mandatory, and will pave the way for a promising future in the development of new medicines with specific therapeutic targets.",

Moderate glial cell activity can be neuroprotective; however, excessive glial cell activation advances the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and is accompanied by structural changes in the brain interface, with peripheral immune cells entering the brain through the blood-brain barrier, creating a vicious circle. The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are primarily conveyed through extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSC-EVs participate in chronic inflammatory and immune processes by transferring nucleic acids, proteins and lipids from the parent cell to the recipient cell, thus MSC-EVs retain their immunomodulatory capacity while avoiding the safety issues associated with living cell therapy, making them a promising focus for immunomodulatory therapy. In this review, we discuss the modulatory effects of MSC-EVs on Alzheimer's disease-associated immune cells and the mechanisms involved in their treatment of the condition. We have found a clinical trial of MSC-EVs in Alzheimer's disease treatment and outlined the challenges of this approach.

Nevertheless, the neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of berberine against AD are not universally recognized. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis by integrating relevant animal studies to assess the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of berberine on AD. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases that reported the effects of berberine on AD models up to 1 February 2023. The escape latency, times of crossing platform, time spent in the target quadrant and pro-oligomerized amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b21-42) were included as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were the Tau-ps 204, Tau-ps 404, \u03b2-site of APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), acetylcholine esterase (AChE), tumor necrosis factor \u237a (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Beclin-1 and neuronal apoptosis cells. This meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 and STATA 15.1. The SYRCLE's risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results: Twenty-two studies and 453 animals were included in the analysis. The overall results showed that berberine significantly shortened the escape latency (p < 0.00001), increased times of crossing platform (p < 0.00001) and time spent in the target quadrant (p < 0.00001), decreased A\u03b21-42 deposition (p < 0.00001), Tau-ps 202 (p < 0.00001) and Tau-ps 404 (p = 0.002), and improved BACE1, APP, AChE, Beclin-1, neuronal apoptosis cells, oxidative stress and inflammation levels. Conclusion: Berberine may be a promising drug for the treatment of AD based on preclinical evidence (especially when the dose was 5-260\u00a0mg/kg). The potential mechanisms for these protective effects may be closely related to anti-neuroinflammation, anti-oxidative stress, modulation of autophagy, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and protection of cholinergic system. However, these results may be limited by the quality of existing research. Larger and methodologically more rigorous preclinical research are needed to provide more convincing evidence.",

Current treatment approaches primarily involve the administration of medications through oral, parenteral, and transdermal routes, aiming to improve cognitive function and alleviate symptoms. However, these treatments face limitations, such as low bioavailability and inadequate permeation. Alternative invasive methods, while explored, often entail discomfort and require specialized assistance. Therefore, the development of a non-invasive and efficient delivery system is crucial. Intranasal delivery has emerged as a potential solution, although it is constrained by the unique conditions of the nasal cavity. An innovative approach involves the use of nano-carriers based on nanotechnology for intranasal delivery. This strategy has the potential to overcome current limitations by providing enhanced bioavailability, improved permeation, effective traversal of the blood-brain barrier, extended retention within the body, and precise targeting of the brain. The comprehensive review focuses on the advancements in designing various types of nano-carriers, including polymeric nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, Quantum dots, and dendrimers. These nano-carriers are specifically tailored for the intranasal delivery of therapeutic agents aimed at combatting Alzheimer's disease. In summary, the development and utilization of intranasal delivery systems based on nanotechnology show significant potential in surmounting the constraints of current Alzheimer's disease treatment strategies.

CSF EV A\u03b242 was decreased (p = 0.0002) and CSF EV Tau/A\u03b242 ratio was increased (p = 0.001) in PWH with HAND vs. no HAND, while soluble forms of these markers showed no significant differences. Decreased CSF EV A\u03b242 (p < 0.0001) and an increased CSF EV Tau/A\u03b242 ratio (p = 0.0003) were associated with lower neurocognitive T scores in age-adjusted models; an optimal model included both CSF EV A\u03b242 and plasma NFL. Levels of soluble, but not EV-associated, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP were increased in PWH with HAND vs. no HAND (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that decreased A\u03b242 and an increased Tau/A\u03b242 ratio in CSF EVs are associated with cognitive impairment in older PWH, and these EV-associated biomarkers may help to distinguish aMCI/AD from HIV-related cognitive disorders in future studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (P. ginseng) is one of the more common traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). It contains numerous chemical components and exhibits a range of pharmacological effects. An enormous burden is placed on people's health and life by Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition. Recent research has shown that P. ginseng's chemical constituents, particularly ginsenosides, have a significant beneficial impact on the prevention and management of neurological disorders. To understand the current status of research on P. ginseng to improve AD, this paper discusses the composition of P. ginseng, its mechanism of action, and its clinical application. The pathogenesis of AD includes amyloid beta protein (A\u03b2) generation and aggregation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidant stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial damage, and neurotransmitter and gut microbiota disorders. This review presents the key molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of the active ingredients in P. ginseng involved in improving AD from the perspective of AD pathogenesis. A P. ginseng-related signaling pathway network was constructed to provide effective targets for the treatment of AD. In addition, the application of spatial metabolomics techniques in studying P. ginseng and AD is discussed. In summary, this paper discusses research perspectives for the study of P. ginseng in the treatment of AD, including a systematic and in-depth review of the mechanisms of action of the active substances in P. ginseng, and evaluates the feasibility of applying spatial metabolomics in the study of AD pathogenesis and pharmacological treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, and some studies have shown that the use of anti-androgen drugs is related to a reduction in cognitive function, mood changes, diminished quality of life, dementia, and possibly Alzheimer's disease. ADT has potential physiological effects such as a reduction in white matter integrity and a negative impact on hypothalamic functions due to the lowering of testosterone levels or the blockade of downstream androgen receptor signaling by first- and second-generation anti-androgen drugs. A comparative analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and Alzheimer patients identified over 30 shared genes, illustrating common ground for the mechanistic underpinning of the symptomatology. The purpose of this review was to investigate the effects of ADT on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life, as well as to analyze the relationship between ADT and Alzheimer's disease. The evaluation of prostate cancer patient cognitive ability via neurocognitive testing is described. Future studies should further explore the connection among cognitive deficits, mood disturbances, and the physiological changes that occur when hormonal balance is altered.",

        "AbstractText": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and other frequent symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and mood disorder. Based on the view that intermittent stress would be the most probable etiology for FM, intermittent cold- and intermittent psychological stress-induced generalized pain (ICGP and IPGP) models in mice have been developed and validated as FM-like pain models in terms of the patho-physiological and pharmacotherapeutic features that are shared with clinical versions. Both models show long-lasting and generalized pain and female-predominant sex differences after gonadectomy. Like many other neuropathic pain models, ICGP and IPGP were abolished in lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) knock-out mice or by LPAR1 antagonist treatments, although deciding the clinical importance of this mechanism depends on waiting for the development of a clinically available LPAR1 antagonist. On the other hand, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac with morphine did not suppress hyperalgesia in these models, and this is consistent with the clinical findings. Pharmacological studies suggest that the lack of morphine analgesia is associated with opioid tolerance upon the stress-induced release of endorphins and subsequent counterbalance through anti-opioid NMDA receptor mechanisms. Regarding pharmacotherapy, hyperalgesia in both models was suppressed by pregabalin and duloxetine, which have been approved for FM treatment in clinic. Notably, repeated treatments with mirtazapine, an \u03b12 adrenergic receptor antagonist-type antidepressant, and donepezil, a drug for treating Alzheimer's disease, showed potent therapeutic actions in these models. However, the pharmacotherapeutic treatment should be carried out 3 months after stress, which is stated in the FM guideline, and many preclinical studies, such as those analyzing molecular and cellular mechanisms, as well as additional evidence using different animal models, are required. Thus, the ICGP and IPGP models have the potential to help discover and characterize new therapeutic medicines that might be used for the radical treatment of FM, although there are several limitations to be overcome.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects as many as 50 million people worldwide. It is neurochemically characterized by an aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles that result in neuronal dysfunction, cognitive decline, and a progressive loss of brain function. TgSwDI is a well-studied transgenic mouse model of AD, but no longitudinal studies have been performed to characterize cognitive deficits or \u03b2-amyloid plaque accumulation for use as a baseline reference in future research. Thus, we use behavioral tests (T-Maze, Novel Object Recognition (NOR), Novel Object Location (NOL)) to study long-term and working memory, and immunostaining to study \u03b2-amyloid plaque deposits, as well as brain size, in hippocampal, cerebellum, and cortical slices in TgSwDI and wild-type (WT) mice at 3, 5, 8, and 12 months old. The behavioral results show that TgSwDI mice exhibit deficits in their long-term spatial memory starting at 8 months old and in long-term recognition memory at all ages, but no deficits in their working memory. Immunohistochemistry showed an exponential increase in \u03b2-amyloid plaque in the hippocampus and cortex of TgSwDI mice over time, whereas there was no significant accumulation of plaque in WT mice at any age. Staining showed a smaller hippocampus and cerebellum starting at 8 months old for the TgSwDI compared to WT mice. Our data show how TgSwDI mice differ from WT mice in their baseline levels of cognitive function and \u03b2-amyloid plaque load throughout their lives.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an extremely devastating neurodegenerative disease, and there is no cure for it. AD is specified as the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) and abnormalities in hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Current approaches to treat Alzheimer's disease have had some success in slowing down the disease's progression. However, attempts to find a cure have been largely unsuccessful, most likely due to the complexity associated with AD pathogenesis. Hence, a shift in focus to better understand the molecular mechanism of A\u03b2 processing and to consider alternative options such as chaperone proteins seems promising. Chaperone proteins act as molecular caretakers to facilitate cellular homeostasis under standard conditions. Chaperone proteins like heat shock proteins (Hsps) serve a pivotal role in correctly folding amyloid peptides, inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction, and peptide aggregation. For instance, Hsp90 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its protein folding mechanisms. In this review, we analyze the most recent studies from 2020 to 2023 and provide updates on A\u03b2 regulation by Hsp90, BRICHOS domain chaperone, and distinctive newly reported chaperones.",

        "AbstractText": "The pattern of olfactory identification change in the early phases of dementing disorders is unclear. We aimed to assess olfactory identification trajectories preceding incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and explore the role of brain pathologies in these trajectories. Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1318 dementia-free older adults were followed annually for up to 11 years. Olfactory identification was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test annually. Of 900 cognitively intact participants, incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Over follow-up, 518 participants died and underwent brain autopsies for neuropathological assessment. Data were analyzed using mixed-effect models with backward timescales. Compared to participants who remained cognitively intact, olfactory identification declined faster among those who developed MCI (\u03b2\u00a0-0.09 [95% CI\u00a0-0.13,\u00a0-0.05]), leading to a significantly lower olfactory identification starting from five years preceding MCI diagnosis (mean difference at year\u00a0-5:\u00a0-0.39 [-0.71,\u00a0-0.07]). Among participants with incident MCI, olfactory identification declined faster in those who developed dementia compared to those who did not (\u03b2\u00a0-0.19 [-0.36,\u00a0-0.01]), leading to a significantly lower olfactory identification starting from three years preceding dementia diagnosis (mean difference at year\u00a0-3:\u00a0-0.95 [-1.67,\u00a0-0.23]). A faster decline in olfactory identification was associated with higher burdens of global Alzheimer's disease pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid beta load. Olfactory identification declined faster preceding dementia disorders and Alzheimer's pathology may underlie these faster declines.

        "AbstractText": "More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible. AI-Mind is a European Research and Innovation Action (RIA H2020-SC1-BHC-06-2020, No. 964220) financed between 2021 and 2026. First, the AI-Mind Connector identifies dysfunctional brain networks based on high-density magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) recordings. Second, the AI-Mind Predictor predicts dementia risk using data from the Connector, enriched with computerized cognitive tests, genetic and protein biomarkers, as well as sociodemographic and clinical variables. AI-Mind is integrated within a network of major European initiatives, including The Virtual Brain, The Virtual Epileptic Patient, and EBRAINS AISBL service for sensitive data, HealthDataCloud, where big patient data are generated for advancing digital and virtual twin technology development. AI-Mind's innovation lies not only in its early prediction of dementia risk, but it also enables a virtual laboratory scenario for hypothesis-driven personalized intervention research.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease are both common life-threatening diseases in the elderly population. Some studies suggest a possible inverse relationship between colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease, but real-world research is subject to many biases. We hope to clarify the causal relationship between the two through a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study. Methods: In our study, we used genetic summary data from large-scale genome-wide association studies to investigate the relationship between colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Our primary analysis employed the inverse-variance weighted method and we also used complementary techniques, including MR-Egger, weighted median estimator, and Maximum likelihood. We applied simex adjustment to the MR-Egger results. We also utilized the MRlap package to detect potential sample overlap and its impact on the bias of the results. In addition, we performed several sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses, to ensure the reliability of our results. Results: The combined effect size results of the inverse-variance weighted method indicate that colorectal cancer may decrease the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.846 (95% CI: 0.762-0.929). Similar results were observed using other methods such as MR-Egger, weighted median estimator, and Maximum likelihood. On the other hand, Alzheimer's disease may slightly increase the incidence of colorectal cancer, with an OR of 1.014 (95% CI: 1.001-1.027). However, the results of one subgroup were not significant, and the results from MRlap indicated that sample overlap introduced bias into the results. Therefore, the results of the reverse validation are not reliable. The F-statistic for all SNPs was greater than 20. Four SNPs related to the outcome were excluded using Phenoscanner website but the adjustment did not affect the overall direction of the results. The results of these statistics were further validated by MR-PRESSO, funnel plots, leave-one-out analyses, Cochran's Q, demonstrating the reliability of the findings. Conclusion: According to the findings of this Mendelian randomization study, there appears to be a causal association between colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. These results could have important implications for clinical practice in terms of how colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease are treated. To better understand the relationship between these two diseases, more research and screening are needed in clinical settings.",

Studies indicate that cognitive reserve theory could be beneficial in this regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between lifestyle socio-behavioral proxies of cognitive reserve and cortical regions in adults with no subjective cognitive decline. Overall, 58 participants, aged 65-85\u2009years, were included in the data analysis (M\u2009=\u200971.83, SD\u2009=\u20095.02, 20.7% male).

Estimated intracranial volume and age were used as covariates. The results indicated that higher occupational complexity was associated with larger cortical volume in the left middle temporal gyrus, the left and right inferior temporal gyrus, and the left inferior parietal lobule, while a combined proxy (the total CRI score) showed a positive relationship with the volume of left middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, and pars orbitalis in the right hemisphere.

By integrating scRNA-seq with new computational frameworks or specific technologies, better Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments may be developed. The single-cell sequencing dataset GSE158234 was obtained from the GEO database. Preprocessing, quality control, dimensionality-reducing clustering, and annotation to identify cell types were performed on it. RNA-seq profiling dataset GSE238013 was used to determine the components of specific cell subpopulations in diverse samples. A set of genes included in the OMIM, Genecards, CTD, and DisGeNET databases were selected as highly plausible AD-related genes. Then, ROC curves were created to predict the diagnostic value using the significantly expressed genes in the KO group as hub genes. The genes mentioned above were mapped to the Coremine Medical database to forecast prospective therapeutic Chinese medicines, and a \"Chinese medicine-ingredient-target\" network was constructed to screen for potential therapeutic targets. The last step was to undertake Mendelian randomization research to determine the causal link between the critical gene IL1B and AD in the genome-wide association study. Using the scRNA-seq dataset, five unique cell clusters were discovered. These clusters were further subdivided into four distinct cell types using marker genes. The KO group showed a more substantial differential subgroup of macrophages than the WT group. By using the available datasets and PPI network analysis, 54 common genes were discovered. Four clusters were identified using the MCODE approach, and correlation analysis showed that seven genes in those four clusters had a significantly negative correlation with macrophages. Six genes in four sets had a significantly positive correlation. Five genes had different levels of expression in the WT and KO groups. The String database was used to identify the regulatory relationships between the four genes (IL10, CX3CR1, IL1B, and IL6) that were finally selected as AD hub genes. Screening identified potential traditional Chinese medicine to intervene in the transformation process of AD, including Radix Salviae, ginseng, Ganoderma, licorice, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix, in addition to promising therapeutic targets, such as PTGS1, PTGS2, and RXRA. Finally, it was shown that IL1B directly correlated with immune cell infiltration in AD. In inverse variance weighting, we found that IL1B was associated with a higher risk of AD, with an OR of 1.003 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.006, p\u2009=\u20090.038).

        "AbstractText": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and epilepsy share proposed mechanisms of injury, including neuronal excitotoxicity, cascade signaling, and activation of protein biomarkers such as tau. Although tau is typically present intracellularly, in tauopathies, phosphorylated (p-) and hyper-phosphorylated (hp-) tau are released extracellularly, the latter leading to decreased neuronal stability and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Tau cleavage at particular sites increases susceptibility to hyper-phosphorylation, NFT formation, and eventual cell death. The relationship between tau and inflammation, however, is unknown. In this review, we present evidence for an imbalanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and inflammatory signaling pathways resulting in atypical p-tau, hp-tau and NFT formation. Further, we propose tau as a biomarker for neuronal injury severity in TBI, AD, and epilepsy. We present a hypothesis of tau phosphorylation as an initial acute neuroprotective response to seizures/TBI. However, if the underlying seizure pathology or TBI recurrence is not effectively treated, and the pathway becomes chronically activated, we propose a \"tipping point\" hypothesis that identifies a transition of tau phosphorylation from neuroprotective to injurious. We outline the role of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) as a \"last ditch effort\" to revert the cell to programmed death signaling, that, when fails, transitions the mechanism from injurious to neurodegenerative. Lastly, we discuss targets along these pathways for therapeutic intervention in AD, TBI, and epilepsy.",

Among the environmental factors, the role of the microbiome in the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) is gaining increased recognition. This paradigm shift is substantiated by an extensive body of scientific literature, which underscores the significant contributions of microorganisms, encompassing viruses and gut-derived bacteria, to the pathogenesis of AD. The mechanism by which microbial infection exerts its influence on AD hinges primarily on inflammation. Neuroinflammation, activated in response to microbial infections, acts as a defense mechanism for the brain but can inadvertently lead to unexpected neuropathological perturbations, ultimately contributing to NDs. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the genetic factors underpinning ND, comprehensive investigations into environmental factors, particularly the microbiome and viral agents, are imperative. Recent advances in neuroscientific research have unveiled the pivotal role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in orchestrating various pathways integral to neurodegenerative pathologies. While the upstream regulators governing the pathological manifestations of microorganisms remain elusive, an in-depth exploration of the nuanced role of ncRNAs holds promise for the development of prospective therapeutic interventions.

A greater understanding of the mechanisms for glymphatic transport may provide insight into how amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and tau agglomerates, key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, accumulate and drive disease progression. In this study, we develop an image-guided computational model to describe glymphatic transport and A\u03b2 deposition throughout the brain. A\u03b2 transport and deposition are modeled using an advection-diffusion equation coupled with an irreversible amyloid accumulation (damage) model. We use immersed isogeometric analysis, stabilized using the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, where the transport model is constructed using parameters inferred from brain imaging data resulting in a subject-specific model that accounts for anatomical geometry and heterogeneous material properties. Both short-term (30-min) and long-term (12-month) 3D simulations of soluble amyloid transport within a mouse brain model were constructed from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data. In addition to matching short-term patterns of tracer deposition, we found that transport parameters such as CSF flow velocity play a large role in amyloid plaque deposition.

Aducanumab was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat AD on June 7, 2021. Aducanumab has shown promising clinical and biomarker efficacy but is associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Neuroradiologists play a critical role in diagnosing ARIA, necessitating familiarity with this condition. This pictorial review will appraise the radiologic presentation of ARIA in patients on aducanumab.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A Potential Role for the Ketogenic Diet in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment: Exploring Pre-Clinical and Clinical Evidence.",
        "AbstractText": "Given the remarkable progress in global health and overall quality of life, the significant rise in life expectancy has become intertwined with the surging occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). This emerging trend is poised to pose a substantial challenge to the fields of medicine and public health in the years ahead. In this context, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as an ND that causes recent memory loss, motor impairment and cognitive deficits. AD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and its development is linked to multifactorial interactions between the environment, genetics, aging and lifestyle. The pathological hallmarks in AD are the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2), the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neurotoxic events and impaired glucose metabolism. Due to pharmacological limitations and in view of the prevailing glycemic hypometabolism, the ketogenic diet (KD) emerges as a promising non-pharmacological possibility for managing AD, an approach that has already demonstrated efficacy in addressing other disorders, notably epilepsy. The KD consists of a food regimen in which carbohydrate intake is discouraged at the expense of increased lipid consumption, inducing metabolic ketosis whereby the main source of energy becomes ketone bodies instead of glucose. Thus, under these dietary conditions, neuronal death via lack of energy would be decreased, inasmuch as the metabolism of lipids is not impaired in AD. In this way, the clinical picture of patients with AD would potentially improve via the slowing down of symptoms and delaying of the progression of the disease. Hence, this review aims to explore the rationale behind utilizing the KD in AD treatment while emphasizing the metabolic interplay between the KD and the improvement of AD indicators, drawing insights from both preclinical and clinical investigations. Via a comprehensive examination of the studies detailed in this review, it is evident that the KD emerges as a promising alternative for managing AD. Moreover, its efficacy is notably enhanced when dietary composition is modified, thereby opening up innovative avenues for decreasing the progression of AD.",

In this review, we summarize potential bioprospecting associated to the genus Alexandrium, including which Alexandrium spp. produce metabolites with anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, as well as anti-Alzheimer applications. When available, we report their mechanisms of action and targets. We also discuss recent progress on the identification of secondary metabolites with biological properties favorable to human health and aquaculture. Altogether, this information highlights the importance of studying which culturing conditions induce the activation of enzymatic pathways responsible for the synthesis of bioactive metabolites. It also suggests considering and comparing clones collected in different locations for toxin monitoring and marine bioprospecting.

        "AbstractText": "This review summarizes the protective effects of probiotics against Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders affecting older adults. This disease is characterized by the deposition of tau and amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) in different parts of the brain. Symptoms observed in patients with AD include struggles with writing, speech, memory, and knowledge. The gut microbiota reportedly plays an important role in brain functioning due to its bidirectional communication with the gut via the gut-brain axis. The emotional and cognitive centers in the brain are linked to the functions of the peripheral intestinal system via this gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, indicating the significance of gut homeostasis for proper brain function. Probiotics play an important role in protecting against the symptoms of AD as they restore gut-brain homeostasis to a great extent. This review summarizes the characteristics, status of gut-brain axis, and significance of gut microbiota in AD. Review and research articles related to the role of probiotics in the treatment of AD were searched in the PubMed database. Recent studies conducted using animal models were given preference. Recent clinical trials were searched for separately. Several studies conducted on animal and human models clearly explain the benefits of probiotics in improving cognition and memory in experimental subjects. Based on these studies, novel therapeutic approaches can be designed for the treatment of patients with AD.",

        "AbstractText": "One of the major obstacles confronting the formulation of a mechanistic understanding for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its immense complexity-a complexity that traverses the full structural and phenomenological spectrum, including molecular, macromolecular, cellular, neurological and behavioural processes. This complexity is reflected by the equally complex diversity of risk factors associated with AD. However, more than merely mirroring disease complexity, risk factors also provide fundamental insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD as a neurodegenerative disorder since they are central to disease initiation and subsequent propagation. Based on a systematic literature assessment, this review identified 30 risk factors for AD and then extended the analysis to further identify neuroinflammation as a unifying mechanism present in all 30 risk factors. Although other mechanisms (e.g., vasculopathy, proteopathy) were present in multiple risk factors, dysfunction of the neuroimmune-neuroinflammation axis was uniquely central to all 30 identified risk factors. Though the nature of the neuroinflammatory involvement varied, the activation of microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were a common pathway shared by all risk factors. This observation provides further evidence for the importance of immunopathic mechanisms in the aetiopathogenesis of AD.",

Recent studies also indicate that certain essential oils demonstrate anti-amyloidogenic activity against \u03b2-amyloid, the protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate whether the anti-aggregating properties of essential oils extend to \u03b1-synuclein, the protein involved in Parkinson's disease, we constructed and employed a whole-cell biosensor based on the split-luciferase complementation assay. We validated our biosensor by using baicalein, a known inhibitor of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and subsequently we tested eight essential oils commonly used in food and the hygienic industry. Two of them, citron and sage, along with their primary components, pure linalool (the main constituent in citron essential oil) and pure eucalyptol (1,8-cineole, the main constituent in sage essential oil), were able to reduce \u03b1-syn aggregation. These findings suggest that both essential oils and their main constituents could be regarded as potential components in functional foods or incorporated into complementary Parkinson's disease therapies.",

Data from 111 consecutive patients with AD admitted to Nanjing First Hospital from 2015 to 2022 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Serum Lp(a) concentrations were grouped into tertiles (T1-T3). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was rated for the presence of CSVD, including enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), lacunes, white-matter lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). The CSVD burden was calculated by summing the scores of each MRI marker at baseline. A binary or ordinal logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationship of serum Lp(a) levels with CSVD burden and each MRI marker. Patients with higher tertiles of Lp(a) levels were less likely to have any CSVD (T1, 94.6%; T2, 78.4%; T3, 66.2%; p = 0.013). Multivariable analysis found that Lp(a) levels were inversely associated with the presence of CSVD (T2 vs. T1: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.132, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.018-0.946, p = 0.044; T3 vs. T1: aOR 0.109, 95% CI 0.016-0.737, p = 0.023) and CSVD burden (T3 vs. T1: aOR 0.576, 95% CI 0.362-0.915, p = 0.019).

        "ArticleTitle": "Flavonoid-Phenolic Acid Hybrids Are Potent Inhibitors of Ferroptosis via Attenuation of Mitochondrial Impairment.",
        "AbstractText": "Cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, and the flavonoids quercetin and taxifolin (dihydroquercetin) are naturally occurring compounds found in plants. They are often referred to as polyphenols and are known, among others, for their pharmacological effects supporting health through the inhibition of aging processes and oxidative stress. To improve their bioavailability, pharmacological activities, and safety, the creation of novel flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids is an area of active research. Previous work showed that such hybridization products of phenolic acids and flavonoids enhanced the resilience of neuronal cells against oxidative stress in vitro, and attenuated cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. Notably, the therapeutic effects of the hybrid compounds we obtained were more pronounced than the protective activities of the respective individual components. The underlying mechanisms mediated by the flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids, however, remained unclear and may differ from the signaling pathways activated by the originating structures of the respective individual phenolic acids or flavonoids. In this study, we characterized the effects of four previously described potent flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids in models of oxidative cell death through ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial ROS generation and has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions. In models of ferroptosis induced by erastin or RSL3, we analyzed mitochondrial (lipid) peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane integrity, and Ca2+ regulation. Our results demonstrate the strong protective effects of the hybrid compounds against ROS formation in the cytosol and mitochondria. Importantly, these protective effects against ferroptosis were not mediated by radical scavenging activities of the phenolic hybrid compounds but through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Our data highlight the effects of flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids on mitochondrial metabolism and further important mitochondrial parameters that collectively determine the health and functionality of mitochondria with a high impact on the integrity and survival of the neuronal cells.",

We aimed to evaluate whether the relationship between years of education and rFC in cognitively preserved older adults differs depending on amyloid-beta deposition and APOE \u03b54 carrier status as effect modifiers. : A total of 121 participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, [18F] flutemetamol positron emission tomography-computed tomography, APOE genotyping, and a neuropsychological battery. Potential interactions between years of education and AD risk factors for rFC of AD-vulnerable neural networks were assessed with whole-brain voxel-wise analysis. : We found a significant education years-by-APOE \u03b54 carrier status interaction for the rFC from the seed region of the central executive (CEN) and dorsal attention networks. Moreover, there was a significant interaction of rFC between right superior occipital gyrus and the CEN seed region by APOE \u03b54 carrier status for memory performances and overall cognitive function. : In preclinical APOE \u03b54 carriers, higher years of education were associated with higher rFC of the AD vulnerable network, but this contributed to lower cognitive function.

This study was designed to investigate the protective action of Cajanus cajan ethanol seed extract (CC) on learning and memory functions using scopolamine mouse model of amnesia. Materials and methods: Adult mice were pretreated with CC (50, 100, or 200mg/kg, p.o) or vehicle (10ml/kg, p.o) for 16 days consecutively. Scopolamine, a competitive muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (1mg/kg, i.p.) was given an hour after CC pretreatment from days 3 to 16.\u00a0 The mice were subjected to behavioural tests from day 11 (open field test (OFT)/ Y-maze test (YMT) and Morris water maze task (MWM) from days 12-16. Animals were euthanized 1h after behavioral test on day 16 and discrete brain regions isolated for markers of oxidative stress and cholinergic signaling. Molecular docking analysis was undertaken to predict the possible mechanism(s) of CC-induced anti-amnesic action.\u00a0 pre-administration of CC significantly reversed working memory and learning deficits caused by scopolamine in YMT and MWM tests, respectively. Moreover, CC prevented scopolamine-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress radicals in the hippocampus evidenced in significant increase in glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities with a marked decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) production, as well as significant inhibition of hippocampal scopolamine-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase activity by CC. The molecular docking analysis showed that out of the 19 compounds, the following had the highest binding affinity; Pinostrobin (-8.7 Kcal/mol), friedeline (-7.5kCal/mol), and lupeol (-8.2 Kcal/mol), respectively, to neuronal muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor, \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and amyloid beta peptide binding pockets, which further supports the ability of CC to enhance neuronal cholinergic signaling and possible inhibition of amyloid beta aggregation.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with the pathological hallmarks of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Although there is a hope that anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies may emerge as a new therapy for AD, the high cost and side effect is a big concern. Non-drug therapy is attracting more attention and may provide a better resolution for the treatment of AD. Given the fact that hypoxia contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be an effective intervention that can alleviate hypoxia and improve AD. However, it remains unclear whether long-term HBOT intervention in the early stage of AD can slow AD progression and ultimately prevent cognitive impairment in this disease. In this study we applied consecutive 3-month HBOT interventions on 3-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice which represent the early stage of AD. When the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 9-month-old which represent the disease stage we measured cognitive function, 24-h blood oxygen saturation, A\u03b2 and tau pathologies, vascular structure and function, and neuroinflammation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our results showed that long-term HBOT can attenuate the impairments in cognitive function observed in 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Most importantly, HBOT effectively reduced the progression of A\u03b2 plaques deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregation, and neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the AD mice. Further, long-term HBOT was able to enhance blood oxygen saturation level. Besides, long-term HBOT can improve vascular structure and function, and reduce neuroinflammation in AD mice. This study is the first to demonstrate that long-term HBOT intervention in the early stage of AD can attenuate cognitive impairment and AD-like pathologies. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of long-term HBOT as a disease-modifying approach for AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a key function in maintaining homeostasis in the brain, partly modulated by transporters, which are highly expressed in brain endothelial cells (BECs). Transporters mediate the uptake or efflux of compounds to and from the brain and they can also challenge the delivery of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently there is a limited understanding of changes in BBB transporters in AD. To investigate this, we generated brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with familial AD (FAD) Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation and identified AD-specific differences in transporter expression compared to control (ctrl) iBECs. We first characterized the expression levels of 12 BBB transporters in AD-, Ctrl-, and isogenic (PSEN1 corrected) iBECs to identify any AD specific differences. We then exposed the cells to focused ultrasound (FUS) in the absence (FUSonly) or presence of microbubbles (MB) (FUS+MB), which is a novel therapeutic method that can be used to transiently open the BBB to increase drug delivery into the brain, however its effects on BBB transporter expression are largely unknown. Following FUSonly and FUS+MB, we investigated whether the expression or activity of key transporters could be modulated. Our findings demonstrate that PSEN1 mutant FAD (PSEN1AD) possess phenotypical differences compared to control iBECs in BBB transporter expression and function. Additionally, we show that FUSonly and FUS+MB can modulate BBB transporter expression and functional activity in iBECs, having potential implications on drug penetration and amyloid clearance. These findings highlight the differential responses of patient cells to FUS treatment, with patient-derived models likely providing an important tool for modelling therapeutic effects of FUS.",

Here, we identify a top hit from high-throughput screening for small molecules that inhibit Tau-FynSH3 interactions and describe its optimization with medicinal chemistry.

Therefore, we created an arterially perfused in situ preparation that allowed us to investigate functional interactions in the CNS from the neonatal to adult period. Decerebrated rodents were kept alive via total artificial cardiopulmonary bypass for extracorporeal circulation; the plasma oxygen and ion components needed for survival were supplied through the blood vessels. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that promotes myeloid cell development and stimulates innate immune responses. In the brain, IRF8 is expressed only in microglia and directs the expression of many genes that serve microglial functions. Recent evidence indicates that IRF8 affects behavior and modulates Alzheimer's disease progression in a mouse model. However, whether this immune deficiency arising from the absence of IRF8 influences the development of the neuronal network in the spinal cord is unknown. We applied the above methodology to mice of all ages and electrophysiologically explored whether the absence of IRF8 influences the development of lumbar central pattern generator (CPG) networks. In mice of all ages, bilateral neuronal discharges by the normal CPG networks activated by the modulated sympathetic tone via descending pathways at high flow rates became organized into discharge episodes punctuated by periods of quiescence. Similar discharge episodes were generated by the adult CPG networks (\u2265P14 days) activated by drug application. However, discharge episodes elicited by activating the neonatal-juvenile CPG networks (<P14 days) occurred alternately on the left and right sides. Interestingly, discharge episodes elicited by the CPG networks in adult IRF8 knockout mice (P11-12\u2009weeks) consisted of those elicited by the CPG networks of both periods. Thus, it was suggested that growing up with immunodeficiency due to loss of IRF8 might interfere with the normal development of functions exerted by the lumbar CPG network because IRF8 plays a role in the normal development of the lumbar CPG network.",

The authors have carried out a descriptive review of scientific papers published from 2015 to 2023. Studies that are included in the PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were analyzed. A descriptive analysis was used to summarized the gleaned information. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their use, are reviewed. The most promising neurotrophic, neuroinflammatory, and genetic markers, including polygenic risk models, are also discussed. The use of biomarkers in clinical practice will contribute to the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimers disease. Genetic screening tests can improve the detection threshold of preclinical abnormalities in the absence of obvious symptoms of cognitive decline. The active use of biomarkers in clinical practice, in combination with genetic screening for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in Alzheimers disease, can improve the timeliness and effectiveness of medical interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "The intricate interplay of one-carbon metabolism (OCM) with various cellular processes has garnered substantial attention due to its fundamental implications in several biological processes. OCM serves as a pivotal hub for methyl group donation in vital biochemical reactions, influencing DNA methylation, protein synthesis, and redox balance. In the context of aging, OCM dysregulation can contribute to epigenetic modifications and aberrant redox states, accentuating cellular senescence and age-associated pathologies. Furthermore, OCM's intricate involvement in cancer progression is evident through its capacity to provide essential one-carbon units crucial for nucleotide synthesis and DNA methylation, thereby fueling uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. In neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, perturbations in OCM pathways are implicated in the dysregulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to disease pathophysiology. This review underscores the profound impact of OCM in diverse disease contexts, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive understanding of its molecular complexities to pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions across inflammation, aging and neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Plasma metabolites distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional metabolomic analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "In multifactorial diseases, alterations in the concentration of metabolites can identify novel pathological mechanisms at the intersection between genetic and environmental influences. This study aimed to profile the plasma metabolome of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two neurodegenerative disorders for which our understanding of the pathophysiology is incomplete. In the clinical setting, DLB is often mistaken for AD, highlighting a need for accurate diagnostic biomarkers. We therefore also aimed to determine the overlapping and differentiating metabolite patterns associated with each and establish whether identification of these patterns could be leveraged as biomarkers to support clinical diagnosis. A panel of 630 metabolites (Biocrates MxP Quant 500) and a further 232 metabolism indicators (biologically informative sums and ratios calculated from measured metabolites, each indicative for a specific pathway or synthesis; MetaboINDICATOR) were analyzed in plasma from patients with probable DLB (n\u2009=\u200915; age 77.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2\u2009years), probable AD (n\u2009=\u200915; 76.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009years), and age-matched cognitively healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200915; 75.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009years). Metabolites were quantified using a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography column and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, or by using flow injection analysis in MRM mode. Data underwent multivariate (PCA analysis), univariate and receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Metabolite data were also correlated (Spearman r) with the collected clinical neuroimaging and protein biomarker data. The PCA plot separated DLB, AD and HC groups (R2\u2009=\u20090.518, Q2\u2009=\u20090.348). Significant alterations in 17 detected metabolite parameters were identified (q\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), including neurotransmitters, amino acids and glycerophospholipids. Glutamine (Glu; q\u2009=\u20090.045) concentrations and indicators of sphingomyelin hydroxylation (q\u2009=\u20090.039) distinguished AD and DLB, and these significantly correlated with semi-quantitative measurement of cardiac sympathetic denervation. The most promising biomarker differentiating AD from DLB was Glu:lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC a 24:0) ratio (AUC\u2009=\u20090.92; 95%CI 0.809-0.996; sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.90; specificity\u2009=\u20090.90). Several plasma metabolomic aberrations are shared by both DLB and AD, but a rise in plasma glutamine was specific to DLB. When measured against plasma lysoPC a C24:0, glutamine could differentiate DLB from AD, and the reproducibility of this biomarker should be investigated in larger cohorts.",

However, there are many peripheral sources of contamination through which concentrations of these metabolites can be raised or lowered after leaving the brain and entering the central venous pool. This raises the issue of potential false conclusions that could lead to erroneous diagnosis or research findings. We propose the use of simultaneous sampling of internal jugular venous and arterial blood to calculate veno-arterial gradient, which can reveal either a surplus or a deficit of metabolites exiting the brain. Methods for sampling internal jugular venous and arterial blood are described along with examples of the use of the veno-arterial gradient in non-AD brain research. Such methods in turn could help better establish the accuracy of forearm venous biomarkers.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Heart rate variability during sleep in synucleinopathies: a review.",
        "AbstractText": "Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal accumulations of insoluble alpha-synuclein in neurons or glial cells. These consist of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Moreover, idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is often the first manifestation of synucleinopathies, demonstrating a pathophysiological continuum. While these disorders vary in prevalence, symptom patterns, and severity, they can all include autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which significantly reduces quality of life and worsens prognosis. Consequently, identifying abnormalities of the ANS can provide opportunities for improving quality of life through symptomatic treatments that are tailored to the individual's symptoms. An exciting development is using heart rate variability (HRV) as a non-invasive research tool for analyzing how the ANS regulates physiological processes. HRV during sleep, however, may provide a more accurate and reliable measure of ANS activity than during wakefulness, as during awake time, ANS activity is influenced by a variety of factors, including physical activity, stress, and emotions, which may mask or confound the underlying patterns of ANS activity. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding sleep-related HRV in synucleinopathies and to discuss contributing mechanisms. Evidence suggests that iRBD, PD, and MSA are associated with nocturnal ANS dysfunction. Further, comparative studies indicate that the presence of RBD could exacerbate this abnormality. In contrast, no studies have been conducted in patients with DLB. Overall, this review provides new insight into the complex interplay between the ANS and synucleinopathies and underscores the need for further research in this area to develop effective therapies to improve sleep and overall quality of life in patients with synucleinopathies.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurons are believed to be non-proliferating cells. However, neuronal stem cells are still present in certain areas of the adult brain, although their proliferation diminishes with age. Just as with other cells, their proliferation and differentiation are modulated by various mechanisms. These mechanisms are foundational to the strategies developed to induce neuronal proliferation and differentiation, with potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative diseases. The most common among these diseases are Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, associated with the formation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregates which cause a reduction in the number of neurons. Compounds such as LiCl, 4-aminothiazoles, Pregnenolone, ACEA, harmine, D2AAK1, methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and shikonin may induce neuronal proliferation/differentiation through the activation of pathways: MAPK ERK, PI3K/AKT, NF\u03baB, Wnt, BDNF, and NPAS3. Moreover, combinations of these compounds can potentially transform somatic cells into neurons. This transformation process involves the activation of neuron-specific transcription factors such as NEUROD1, NGN2, ASCL1, and SOX2, which subsequently leads to the transcription of downstream genes, culminating in the transformation of somatic cells into neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases are not the only conditions where inducing neuronal proliferation could be beneficial. Consequently, the impact of pro-proliferative compounds on neurons has also been researched in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal proliferation and differentiation can be used as a treatment strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Several low-molecular-weight chemical compounds have been described to induce neuronal cell proliferation. [Figure: see text]",

This study investigates the potential therapeutic properties of venoms from echinoderms in the Persian Gulf, specifically their ability to inhibit cholinesterases (Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) and act as antioxidants. Methods: Four venoms from two echinoderm species, including the spine, gonad, and coelomic fluids of sea urchins, as well as brittle star venoms, were analyzed using various methods, including LD50 determination, protein analysis, antioxidant assays, GC-MS for secondary metabolite identification, and molecular docking simulations. Results and discussion: The study's results revealed the LD50 of the samples as follows: 2.231 \u00b1 0.09, 1.03 \u00b1 0.05, 1.12 \u00b1 0.13, and 6.04 \u00b1 0.13\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the protein levels were 44.037 \u00b1 0.002, 74.223 \u00b1 0.025, 469.97 \u00b1 0.02, and 104.407 \u00b1 0.025\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. SDS-PAGE and total protein studies indicated that at least part of the venom was proteinaceous. Furthermore, the study found that the brittle star samples exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to other samples, including the standard ascorbic acid, at all tested concentrations. GC-MS analysis identified 12, 23, 21, and 25 compounds in the samples, respectively. These compounds had distinct chemical and bioactive structures, including alkaloids, terpenes, and steroids. Conclusion: These venoms displayed strong cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant activities, likely attributed to their protein content and the presence of alkaloids, terpenes, and steroids. Notably, the alkaloid compound C 7 was identified as a promising candidate for further research in Alzheimer's disease therapy. In conclusion, echinoderms in the Persian Gulf may hold significant potential for discovering novel therapeutic agents.",

It also proposes the development of a minimally invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) photonic chip for monitoring and diagnosing AD, offering high spatiotemporal resolution of brain activity. The study used a rodent model of sporadic AD, demonstrating that STZ-induced sAD resulted in increased hippocampal UPE, which was associated with oxidative stress.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between visit-to-visit fasting glucose variability and PDD development in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we examined 9,264 patients aged \u226540\u2009years with de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent \u22653 health examinations and were followed up until December 2019.

Fine and Gray competing regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of glucose variability on incident PDD. During the 9.5-year follow-up period, 1,757 of 9,264 (19.0%) patients developed PDD. Patients with a higher visit-to-visit glucose variability had a higher risk of future PDD. In the multivariable adjusted model, patients with PD in the highest quartile (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]\u2009=\u20091.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88), quartile 3 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.62), and quartile 2 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.63) were independently associated with a higher risk of PDD than those in the lowest quartile.

MRI and, more recently, AI methods have been instrumental in understanding the neuroanatomical changes that occur during aging in large and diverse populations. However, the multiplicity and mutual overlap of both pathologic processes and affected brain regions make it difficult to precisely characterize the underlying neurodegenerative profile of an individual from an MRI scan. Herein, we leverage a state-of-the art deep representation learning method, Surreal-GAN, and present both methodological advances and extensive experimental results that allow us to elucidate the heterogeneity of brain aging in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals from 11 studies. Five dominant patterns of neurodegeneration were identified and quantified for each individual by their respective (herein referred to as) R-indices. Significant associations between R-indices and distinct biomedical, lifestyle, and genetic factors provide insights into the etiology of observed variances. Furthermore, baseline R-indices showed predictive value for disease progression and mortality.

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",

        "AbstractText": "Measurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans (~1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as \"cluster scanning.\" Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.",

        "AbstractText": "Nearly two-thirds of patients with Alzheimer's are women. Identifying therapeutics specific for women is critical to lowering their elevated risk for developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic processes that regulate multiple cellular pathways is advantageous given Alzheimer's multifactorial nature. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic process heavily involved in memory consolidation. Its disruption is linked to Alzheimer's. Through our computational studies, we predicted that the investigational drug RG2833 (N-[6-(2-aminoanilino)-6-oxohexyl]-4-methylbenzamide) has repurposing potential for Alzheimer's. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier. We investigated the RG2833 therapeutic potential in TgF344-AD rats, which are a model of Alzheimer's that exhibits age-dependent progression, thus mimicking this aspect of Alzheimer's patients that is difficult to establish in animal models. We investigated the RG2833 effects on cognitive performance, gene expression, and AD-like pathology in 11-month TgF344-AD female and male rats. A total of 89 rats were used: wild type n = 45 (17 females, 28 males), and TgF344-AD n = 44 (24 females, 20 males)] across multiple cohorts. No obvious toxicity was detected in the TgF344-AD rats up to 6 months of RG2833-treatment starting at 5 months of age administering the drug in rodent chow at \u223c30mg/kg of body weight. We started treatment early in the course of pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be more effective than in later stages of the disease. The drug-treatment significantly mitigated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits in 11-month TgF344-AD females but not in males, compared to wild type littermates. This female sex-specific drug effect has not been previously reported. RG2833-treatment failed to ameliorate amyloid beta accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats. However, RNAseq analysis of hippocampal tissue from TgF344-AD rats showed that drug-treatment in females upregulated the expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant changes in gene expression were detected in males at P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05, and fold-change \u2265 1.5. Our data suggest that histone modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 improve cognitive behavior by modulating the expression of immediate early, neuroprotective and synaptic plasticity genes. Our preclinical study supports that RG2833 has therapeutic potential specifically for female Alzheimer's patients. RG2833 evaluations using other AD-related models is necessary to confirm our findings.",

The total-body EXPLORER PET scanner supports the dynamic acquisition of a full human body simultaneously and permits noninvasive image-derived input functions (IDIFs) as an alternative to arterial blood sampling. This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic 18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort. 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 seconds after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 minutes were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM). Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VT and VS in anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent with BPND analysis. BPND and VT from kinetic models were correlated (r2 = 0.46, P<2e-16) with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs. VT from 2TCM was highly correlated (r2 = 0.65, P< 2e-16) with Logan graphical VT estimation.

Phytochemical profiles of OCP using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ECI-MS/MS) identified 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and ferulic acid as the major compounds. Antioxidant activities and enzyme inhibitory activities toward the major enzymes involved in obesity (lipase), diabetes (\u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV)), Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and \u03b2-secretase-1 (BACE-1)), hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE), and genotoxicity were also investigated. Results showed that H. heteroclita OCP possessed antioxidant activity and potential inhibitory activities against BACE-1 and ACE, while also being genome-safe. A simple extraction method for H. heteroclita OCP was developed, demonstrating the enhanced value of its phytochemical and health-promoting qualities.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Janus face of antipsychotics in glial cells: Focus on glioprotection.",
        "AbstractText": "Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed to treat several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, mania in bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, delirium, and organic or secondary psychosis, for example, in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence that typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol are more effective in reducing positive symptoms than negative symptoms and/or cognitive deficits. In contrast, atypical antipsychotic agents have gained popularity over typical antipsychotics, due to fewer extrapyramidal side effects and their theoretical efficacy in controlling both positive and negative symptoms. Although these therapies focus on neuron-based therapeutic schemes, glial cells have been recognized as important regulators of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as targets to improve the efficacy of these drugs. Glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) are critical for the central nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells and play important roles in brain homeostasis, regulating neurotransmitter systems and gliotransmission, since they express a wide variety of functional receptors for different neurotransmitters. In addition, converging lines of evidence indicate that psychiatric disorders are commonly associated with the triad neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity, and that glial cells may contribute to the gliotoxicity process. Conversely, glioprotective molecules attenuate glial damage by generating specific responses that can protect glial cells themselves and/or neurons, resulting in improved central nervous system (CNS) functioning. In this regard, resveratrol is well-recognized as a glioprotective molecule, including in clinical studies of schizophrenia and autism. This review will provide a summary of the dual role of antipsychotics on neurochemical parameters associated with glial functions and will highlight the potential activity of glioprotective molecules to improve the action of antipsychotics.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes dementia among older adults, increasing the global burden of dementia. Therefore, this study investigates the potential neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anticancer effects of chamomile essential oil (CCO) in Alzheimer's disease. CCO's main volatile compounds (VOCs) were \u03b1-bisabolol, camazulene, and bisabolol oxide A, representing 81 % of all VOCs. CCO scavenged 93 % of DPPH free radicals and inhibited the pathogenic bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi, besides reducing 89 % of brain cancer cell lines (U87). Eighty albino rats were randomized into four groups: standard control, Alzheimer's disease group caused by AlCl3, and treated groups. The results indicated that the mean value of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (A\u03b2), caspase-3, & B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was significantly elevated due to the harmful effect of AlCl3; however, CCO downregulated these values, and this effect was attributed to the considerable volatile compounds and phenolic compounds content. Additionally, CCO rats showed a significant increment in noradrenergic (NE), dopaminergic (DO), and serotoninergic systems with relative increases of 50, 50, and 14 % compared to diseased rats. The brain histology of CCO-treated rats showed a significant reduction in neuronal degeneration and improved brain changes, and its histology was close to that of the control brain. The results indicated that CCO offers a new strategy that could be used as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent for AD due to its considerable contents of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.",

The mechanisms underpinning such symptoms remain elusive. Recent research has demonstrated that nervous system injury can occur during COVID-19. Whether ongoing neural injury in the months after COVID-19 accounts for the ongoing or emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms is unclear. Within a large prospective cohort study of adult survivors who were hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we analysed plasma markers of nervous system injury and astrocytic activation, measured 6 months post-infection: neurofilament light, glial fibrillary acidic protein and total tau protein. We assessed whether these markers were associated with the severity of the acute COVID-19 illness and with post-acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression, the General Anxiety Disorder assessment for anxiety, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for objective cognitive deficit and the cognitive items of the Patient Symptom Questionnaire for subjective cognitive deficit) at 6 months and 1 year post-hospital discharge from COVID-19. No robust associations were found between markers of nervous system injury and severity of acute COVID-19 (except for an association of small effect size between duration of admission and neurofilament light) nor with post-acute neuropsychiatric symptoms. These results suggest that ongoing neuropsychiatric symptoms are not due to ongoing neural injury.",

However, previous studies have reported inconsistent results. The study aimed to investigate the association between CHD, HF, and the risk of AD using a meta-analysis. STATA 12.0 software is used to compute odds ratios (ORs)/relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between CHD, HF, and the risk of AD. A total of 12 studies (including N = 36,913 individuals with AD and N = 1,701,718 participants) investigated the association between CHD and the risk of AD. Meta-analysis indicated that CHD was associated with an increased risk of AD with a random effects model (OR/RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.00-1.48, I2 = 97.2%, P < 0.001). Additionally, seven studies (including N = 5,119 individuals with AD and N = 1,231,399 participants) investigated the association between myocardial infarction (MI) and the risk of AD. Our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant association between MI and the risk of AD with a fixed effects model (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.91-1.30, I2 = 42.8%, P = 0.105). Finally, six studies (including N = 83,065 individuals with AD and N = 2,414,963 participants) examined the association between HF and the risk of AD. Our meta-analysis revealed that HF was associated with an increased risk of AD using a random effects model (RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24, I2 = 96.8%, P < 0.001). In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that CHD and HF are associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Nonetheless, more large-scale prospective studies are necessary to further investigate the associations between CHD, HF, and the risk of AD.",

However, some older adult people with AD pathological hallmarks can retain cognitive function. Unraveling the factors that lead to this cognitive resilience to AD offers promising prospects for identifying new therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis focuses on the contribution of resilience to changes in excitatory synapses at the structural and molecular levels, which may underlie healthy cognitive performance in aged AD animals. Utilizing the Morris Water Maze test, we selected resilient (asymptomatic) and cognitively impaired aged Tg2576 mice. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed similar levels of A\u03b242 in both experimental groups, western blot analysis revealed differences in tau pathology in the pre-synaptic supernatant fraction. To further investigate the density of synapses in the hippocampus of 16-18 month-old Tg2576 mice, we employed stereological and electron microscopic methods. Our findings indicated a decrease in the density of excitatory synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 in cognitively impaired Tg2576 mice compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Intriguingly, through quantitative immunoelectron microscopy in the hippocampus of impaired and resilient Tg2576 transgenic AD mice, we uncovered differences in the subcellular localization of glutamate receptors. Specifically, the density of GluA1, GluA2/3, and mGlu5 in spines and dendritic shafts of CA1 pyramidal cells in impaired Tg2576 mice was significantly reduced compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Notably, the density of GluA2/3 in resilient Tg2576 mice was significantly increased in spines but not in dendritic shafts compared with impaired Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice. These subcellular findings strongly support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity and synaptic machinery in the hippocampus play crucial roles in the mechanisms of cognitive resilience in Tg2576 mice.",

However, the mechanisms modulating these processes in different diseases remain incompletely understood. Advances in single cell based multi-omic analyses have helped to identify distinct molecular signatures such as Lgals3 that is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Lgals3 encodes galectin-3 (Gal3), a \u03b2-galactoside and glycan binding glycoprotein that is frequently upregulated by reactive microglia/macrophages in the CNS during various neurological diseases. While Gal3 has previously been associated with non-CNS inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, recent studies highlight Gal3 as a prominent regulator of inflammation and neuroaxonal damage in the CNS during diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we summarize the pleiotropic functions of Gal3 and discuss evidence that demonstrates its detrimental role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration during different neurological diseases.

A primary reactive oxygen species contributor in the central nervous system, NADPH oxidase 4, is viewed as a potential therapeutic touchstone and indicative marker for these ailments. This in-depth review brings to light distinct features of NADPH oxidase 4, responsible for generating superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, emphasizing its pivotal role in activating glial cells, inciting inflammation, and disturbing neuronal functions. Significantly, malfunctioning astrocytes, forming the majority in the central nervous system, play a part in advancing neurodegenerative diseases, due to their reactive oxygen species and inflammatory factor secretion. Our study reveals that aiming at NADPH oxidase 4 within astrocytes could be a viable treatment pathway to reduce oxidative damage and halt neurodegenerative processes. Adjusting NADPH oxidase 4 activity might influence the neuroinflammatory cytokine levels, including myeloperoxidase and osteopontin, offering better prospects for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Blood-brain barrier breakdown is a common pathology in various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Traditionally, it has been considered a consequence of neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration, but recent advanced imaging techniques and detailed studies in animal models show that blood-brain barrier breakdown occurs early in the disease process and may precede neuronal loss. Thus, the blood-brain barrier is attractive as a potential therapeutic target for neurological diseases that lack effective therapeutics. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying blood-brain barrier breakdown and translate them into therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, there is a growing demand for experimental models of human origin that allow for functional assessments. Recently, several human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived blood-brain barrier models have been established and various in vitro blood-brain barrier models using microdevices have been proposed. Especially in the Alzheimer's disease field, the human evidence for blood-brain barrier dysfunction has been demonstrated and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived blood-brain barrier models have suggested the putative molecular mechanisms of pathological blood-brain barrier. In this review, we summarize recent evidence of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease from pathological analyses, imaging studies, animal models, and stem cell sources.

        "ArticleTitle": "How do neurons age? A focused review on the aging of the microtubular cytoskeleton.",
        "AbstractText": "Aging is the leading risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We now understand that a breakdown in the neuronal cytoskeleton, mainly underpinned by protein modifications leading to the destabilization of microtubules, is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This is accompanied by morphological defects across the somatodendritic compartment, axon, and synapse. However, knowledge of what occurs to the microtubule cytoskeleton and morphology of the neuron during physiological aging is comparatively poor. Several recent studies have suggested that there is an age-related increase in the phosphorylation of the key microtubule stabilizing protein tau, a modification, which is known to destabilize the cytoskeleton in Alzheimer's disease. This indicates that the cytoskeleton and potentially other neuronal structures reliant on the cytoskeleton become functionally compromised during normal physiological aging. The current literature shows age-related reductions in synaptic spine density and shifts in synaptic spine conformation which might explain age-related synaptic functional deficits. However, knowledge of what occurs to the microtubular and actin cytoskeleton, with increasing age is extremely limited. When considering the somatodendritic compartment, a regression in dendrites and loss of dendritic length and volume is reported whilst a reduction in soma volume/size is often seen. However, research into cytoskeletal change is limited to a handful of studies demonstrating reductions in and mislocalizations of microtubule-associated proteins with just one study directly exploring the integrity of the microtubules. In the axon, an increase in axonal diameter and age-related appearance of swellings is reported but like the dendrites, just one study investigates the microtubules directly with others reporting loss or mislocalization of microtubule-associated proteins. Though these are the general trends reported, there are clear disparities between model organisms and brain regions that are worthy of further investigation. Additionally, longitudinal studies of neuronal/cytoskeletal aging should also investigate whether these age-related changes contribute not just to vulnerability to disease but also to the decline in nervous system function and behavioral output that all organisms experience. This will highlight the utility, if any, of cytoskeletal fortification for the promotion of healthy neuronal aging and potential protection against age-related neurodegenerative disease. This review seeks to summarize what is currently known about the physiological aging of the neuron and microtubular cytoskeleton in the hope of uncovering mechanisms underpinning age-related risk to disease.",

Various studies have examined obstructive sleep apnoea, sleep duration, and circadian alterations in relation to Alzheimer's pathology and dementia risk, with an emerging body of evidence suggesting that cardiovascular disease, hypertension, glymphatic function, and inflammation might serve as plausible pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to dementia during critical brain periods. Conversely, recent studies investigating insomnia have produced disparate results. Regarding intervention studies, the scarcity of prospective randomised control trials poses a challenge in establishing the benefits of addressing sleep disorders and disturbances. Recent work examining the pathophysiological links between sleep and dementia is strongest for obstructive sleep apnoea and sleep duration, while findings in insomnia studies exhibit inconsistency, possibly due to varied associations with dementia among different insomnia subtypes. It is apparent that more longitudinal studies examining the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are necessary, alongside more rigorous clinical trials.

A cPLA2-IVA inhibiting peptide was identified in the present work, aiming to develop an original therapeutic strategy. We targeted the cPLA2-IVA using the phage display technology. The hit peptide PLP25 was first validated in vitro (arachidonic acid dosage [AA], cPLA2-IVA cellular translocation) before being tested in vivo.

Showing a high affinity for the C2 domain of this enzyme, the peptide PLP25 exhibited an inhibitory effect on cPLA2-IVA activity by blocking its binding to its substrate, resulting in a decreased release of AA.

A previous study in a Southern region reported one of the highest prevalences of dementia in Latin America. To investigate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment associated with low education, rurality, and demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study recruited a community-dwelling sample of 823 adults from rural and urban areas of two Southern provinces of Colombia from 2020-2022. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological protocol validated in Colombia. To obtain general and region-specific prevalence rates, age, sex, schooling, and socioeconomic level were considered and controlled for. Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher. It was determined that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 53.6%, with 56.6% in the province of Caquet\u00e1 followed by 51.9% in the province of Huila. The amnestic MCI represented 42.6%, the amnestic multi-domain was 39%, the non-amnestic 16.55%, and the non-amnestic multi-domain 1.81%. Our participants reported comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also observed a relationship between exposure to pesticides and MCI. We observed one of the highest prevalences of MCI in Latin America reported to date. Variables such as age, gender, and education proved risk factors for MCI in the explored regions.

This study aimed to investigate the association of serum liver enzymes with brain amyloidopathy and cognitive performance in patients with complaints of cognitive decline. A total of 1,036 patients (mean age 74 years, 66.2% female) with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases were included using the Smart Clinical Data Warehouse. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations, and measurements of liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and albumin, were assessed. After propensity score matching, logistic and linear regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between liver enzymes, amyloid status, and cognitive performance. Additionally, a machine learning approach was used to assess the classification performance of liver enzymes in predicting amyloid PET positivity. Lower ALT levels and higher AST-to-ALT ratios were significantly associated with amyloid PET positivity and AD diagnosis. The AST-to-ALT ratio was also significantly associated with poor memory function. Machine learning analysis revealed that the classification performance of amyloid status (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.642) for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E \u025b4 carrier status significantly improved by 6.2% by integrating the AST-to-ALT ratio.

To assess the efficacy of a comprehensive intervention (CI) in modulating serum cortisol levels in patients with AD. CI consisted in a 2-month protocol involving cognitive stimulation, psychological support, lifestyle guidance, leisure activities, and socialization. AD subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (EG, n\u200a=\u200a45) and control (CG, n\u200a=\u200a45) groups. A wide range of sociodemographic, cognitive, psychosocial, and functional conditions were evaluated before, at the conclusion, and 24 months after CI. Data about lifestyle and drug prescription were also recorded. Baseline evaluations revealed that higher cortisol levels correlated with worse cognitive status (higher CDR and ADAS-Cog values and lower MMSE scores), increased depressive symptoms, and reduced physical and social engagement. Following CI, EG exhibited reduced cortisol levels, improved overall cognitive status, and enhanced verbal working memory and executive functions compared to CG. However, at the 24-month follow-up, EG displayed a rebound effect, characterized by elevated cortisol levels and cognitive decline compared to CG. These findings strengthen the adverse relationship between excessive cortisol and deficits in cognition/behavior in AD, demonstrate the short-term benefits of CI, and emphasize the potential long-term risks, which may be attributed to the fragile nature of the AD brain. Comprehensive interventions can yield positive results, but careful calibration of type and duration is necessary, considering disease progression and the potential need for re-administration.",

Abnormal metabolism of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) has been proposed as a significant pathomechanism in AD, supported by results of recent clinical trials using anti-A\u03b2 antibodies. Nonetheless, the cognitive benefits of the current treatments are limited. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, encompassing A\u03b2 and tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, demyelination, vascular dysfunction, and comorbidities, which collectively lead to widespread neurodegeneration in the brain and cognitive impairment. Hence, solely removing A\u03b2 from the brain may be insufficient to combat neurodegeneration and preserve cognition. To attain effective treatment for AD, it is necessary to (1) conduct extensive research on various mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration, including advances in neuroimaging techniques for earlier detection and a more precise characterization of molecular events at scales ranging from cellular to the full system level; (2) identify neuroprotective intervention targets against different neurodegeneration mechanisms; and (3) discover novel and optimal combinations of neuroprotective intervention strategies to maintain cognitive function in AD patients. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroprotection Research Initiative's objective is to facilitate coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts to develop systemic neuroprotective strategies to combat AD.

        "AbstractText": "Fresh ginseng is prone to spoilage due to its high moisture content. For long-term storage, most fresh ginsengs are dried to white ginseng (WG) or steamed for hours at high temperature/pressure and dried to form Korean Red ginseng (KRG). They are further processed for ginseng products when subjected to hot water extraction/concentration under pressure. These WG or KRG preparation processes affect ginsenoside compositions and also other ginseng components, probably during treatments like steaming and drying, to form diverse bioactive phospholipids. It is known that ginseng contains high amounts of gintonin lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs). LPAs are simple lipid-derived growth factors in animals and humans and act as exogenous ligands of six GTP-binding-protein coupled LPA receptor subtypes. LPAs play diverse roles ranging from brain development to hair growth in animals and humans. LPA-mediated signaling pathways involve various GTP-binding proteins to regulate downstream pathways like [Ca2+]i transient induction. Recent studies have shown that gintonin exhibits anti-Alzheimer's disease and anti-arthritis effects in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo mediated by gintonin LPAs, the active ingredients of gintonin, a ginseng-derived neurotrophin. However, little is known about how gintonin LPAs are formed in high amounts in ginseng compared to other herbs. This review introduces atypical or non-enzymatic pathways under the conversion of ginseng phospholipids into gintonin LPAs during steaming and extraction/concentration processes, which exert beneficial effects against degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and arthritis in animals and humans via LPA receptors.",

Therefore, the development of a new drug is necessarily needed. We focused on the cognitive function of Panax ginseng and tried to find active ingredient(s). We isolated panaxcerol D, a kind of glycosyl glyceride, from the non-saponin fraction of P.\u00a0ginseng extract. We explored effects of acute or sub-chronic administration of panaxcerol D on cognitive function in scopolamine- or A\u03b225-35 peptide-treated mice measured by several behavioral tests. After behavioral tests, we tried to unveil the underlying mechanism of panaxcerol D on its cognitive function by Western blotting. We found that pananxcerol D reversed short-term, long-term and object recognition memory impairments. The decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in scopolamine-treated mice was normalized by acute administration of panaxcerol D. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), caspase 3, NF-kB p65, synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression levels in A\u03b225-35 peptide-treated mice were modulated by sub-chronic administration of panaxcerol D. Pananxcerol D could improve memory impairments caused by cholinergic blockade or A\u03b2 accumulation through increased phosphorylation level of ERK or its anti-inflammatory effect.

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), produced in the dietary choline metabolism, has been found to accelerate neurodegeneration in AD pathology. In this study, the cognitive function and gut microbiota of TgCRND8 (Tg) mice of different ages were evaluated by Morris water maze task (MWMT) and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. Young pseudo germ-free (PGF) Tg mice that received faecal microbiota transplants from aged Tg mice and wild-type (WT) mice were selected to determine the role of the gut microbiota in the process of neuropathology. Excessive choline treatment for Tg mice was used to investigate the role of abnormal choline metabolism on the cognitive functions. Our results showed that gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation response, A\u03b2 deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, TMAO overproduction and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)/transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurred in Tg mice age-dependently. Disordered microbiota of aged Tg mice accelerated AD pathology in young Tg mice, with the activation of CDK5/STAT3 signaling in the brains. On the contrary, faecal microbiota transplantation from WT mice alleviated the cognitive deficits, attenuated neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, TMAO overproduction and suppressed CDK5/STAT3 pathway activation in Tg mice. Moreover, excessive choline treatment was also shown to aggravate the cognitive deficits, A\u03b2 deposition, neuroinflammation and CDK5/STAT3 pathway activation.

While amyloid fibrils typically consist of parallel \u03b2-sheets, the anti-parallel \u03b2-hairpin is a structural motif accessible to amyloidogenic proteins in their monomeric and oligomeric states. Here, to investigate implications of \u03b2-hairpins in amyloid formation, potential \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic segments in the human proteome were predicted based on sequence similarity with \u03b2-hairpins previously observed in A\u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein, and islet amyloid polypeptide, amyloidogenic proteins associated with AD, PD, and T2D, respectively. These three \u03b2-hairpins, established upon binding to the engineered binding protein \u03b2-wrapin AS10, are characterized by proximity of two sequence segments rich in hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, with high \u03b2-aggregation scores according to the TANGO algorithm. Using these criteria, 2505 potential \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic segments in 2098 human proteins were identified. Characterization of a test set of eight protein segments showed that seven assembled into Thioflavin T-positive aggregates and four formed \u03b2-hairpins in complex with AS10 according to NMR. One of those is a segment of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) comprising amino acids 185-208. PAP is naturally cleaved into fragments, including PAP(248-286) which forms functional amyloid in semen. We find that PAP(185-208) strongly decreases the protein concentrations required for fibril formation of PAP(248-286) and of another semen amyloid peptide, SEM1(86-107), indicating that it promotes nucleation of semen amyloids. In conclusion, \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic protein segments could be identified in the human proteome with potential roles in functional or disease-related amyloid formation.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Does activation of oxytocinergic reward circuits postpone the decline of the aging brain?",
        "AbstractText": "Oxytocin supports reproduction by promoting sexual- and nursing behavior. Moreover, it stimulates reproductive organs by different avenues. Oxytocin is released to the blood from terminals of oxytocinergic neurons which project from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. Concomitantly, the dendrites of these neurons discharge oxytocin into neighboring areas of the hypothalamus. At this location it affects other neuroendocrine systems by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Moreover, sensory processing, affective functions, and reward circuits are influenced by oxytocinergic neurons that reach different sites in the brain. In addition to its facilitating impact on various aspects of reproduction, oxytocin is revealed to possess significant anti-inflammatory, restoring, and tranquilizing properties. This has been demonstrated both in many in-vivo and in-vitro studies. The oxytocin system may therefore have the capacity to alleviate detrimental physiological- and mental stress reactions. Thus, high levels of endogenous oxytocin may counteract inadequate inflammation and malfunctioning of neurons and supportive cells in the brain. A persistent low-grade inflammation increasing with age-referred to as inflammaging-may lead to a cognitive decline but may also predispose to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson. Interestingly, animal studies indicate that age-related destructive processes in the body can be postponed by techniques that preserve immune- and stem cell functions in the hypothalamus. It is argued in this article that sexual activity-by its stimulating impact on the oxytocinergic activity in many regions of the brain-has the capacity to delay the onset of age-related cerebral decay. This may also postpone frailty and age-associated diseases in the body. Finally, oxytocin possesses neuroplastic properties that may be applied to expand sexual reward. The release of oxytocin may therefore be further potentiated by learning processes that involves oxytocin itself. It may therefore be profitable to raise the consciousness about the potential health benefits of sexual activity particularly among the seniors.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Functional unfoldomics: Roles of intrinsic disorder in protein (multi)functionality.",
        "AbstractText": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are functional proteins without stable tertiary structure, and hybrid proteins containing ordered domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) constitute prominent parts of all proteomes collectively known as unfoldomes. IDPs/IDRs exist as highly dynamic structural ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformations and are characterized by the exceptional structural heterogeneity, where their different parts are (dis)ordered to different degree, and their overall structure represents a complex mosaic of foldons, inducible foldons, inducible morphing foldons, non-foldons, semifoldons, and even unfoldons. Despite their lack of unique 3D structures, IDPs/IDRs play crucial roles in the control of various biological processes and the regulation of different cellular pathways and are commonly involved in recognition and signaling, indicating that the disorder-based functional repertoire is complementary to the functions of ordered proteins. Furthermore, IDPs/IDRs are frequently multifunctional, and this multifunctionality is defined by their structural flexibility and heterogeneity. Intrinsic disorder phenomenon is at the roots of the structure-function continuum model, where the structure continuum is defined by the presence of differently (dis)ordered regions, and the function continuum arises from the ability of all these differently (dis)ordered parts to have different functions. In their everyday life, IDPs/IDRs utilize a broad spectrum of interaction mechanisms thereby acting as interaction specialists. They are crucial for the biogenesis of numerous proteinaceous membrane-less organelles driven by the liquid-liquid phase separation. This review introduces functional unfoldomics by representing some aspects of the intrinsic disorder-based functionality.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe and progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the treatment options that are currently available are limited. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has had a significant influence in explaining the pathology underlying AD. Inhibiting the production and aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and promoting its clearance have been important strategies in the development of anti-AD drugs over the past two decades. Specifically, A\u03b2 directed antibodies have been highly anticipated, but drug development has been fraught with obstacles and challenges. Antibodies targeting the C-terminal or central region of A\u03b2, such as ponezumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab, primarily bind to A\u03b2 monomers, yet no significant clearance of brain plaques or slowing of disease progression has been observed in clinical trials. Antibodies targeting the N-terminal region of A\u03b2, including aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, primarily bind to aggregated forms of A\u03b2, and have shown efficacy in clearing brain plaques and slowing early-stage AD progression in clinical trials. However, clinical trials of gantenerumab, which targets conformational epitopes in the N-terminal and central sequences of A\u03b2 and which selectively binds to aggregated forms, have failed, raising some new questions about the A\u03b2 hypothesis. Advances in research on the pathological mechanisms of AD and advances in early diagnostic techniques may shift the time window for drug intervention and offer a potential pathway for developing effective drugs to delay the onset and progression of AD in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "The aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) including miR-29c-3p have been reported in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in recent researches. Nevertheless, the functional role and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-29c-3p in AD pathogenesis are still not well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine whether miR-29c-3p regulated beta-Ameyloid (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity by targeting beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The expressions of miR 29c 3p and BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in Abeta-treated PC12 cellular AD model were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. Luciferase reporter assay verified the potential target of miR 29c 3p. Cell viability, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells were detected by the MTT assay, flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activity assay, respectively. Our results indicated that miR-29c-3p downregulation and BACE1 upregulation existed in the cellular AD model of PC12 cells. Moreover, miR-29c-3p directly inhibited BACE1 expression. miR-29c-3p overexpression and BACE1 knockdown strengthened Abeta-induced cell apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells, which was partially eliminated by over-expression of BACE1. Conversely, BACE1 knockdown reversed the miR-29c-3p inhibition- mediated inhibitory effect on Abeta-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells. Considering, miR-29c-3p attenuated Abeta-induced neurotoxicity through targeting BACE1 in an cellular AD model of PC12, providing a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Large language models (LLMs) can generate natural language texts for various domains and tasks, but their potential for clinical text mining, a domain with scarce, sensitive, and imbalanced medical data, is under-explored. We investigate whether LLMs can augment clinical data for detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related signs and symptoms from electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task that requires high expertise. We create a novel pragmatic taxonomy for AD sign and symptom progression based on expert knowledge and generated three datasets: (1) a gold dataset annotated by human experts on longitudinal EHRs of AD patients; (2) a silver dataset created by the data-to-label method, which labels sentences from a public EHR collection with AD-related signs and symptoms; and (3) a bronze dataset created by the label-to-data method which generates sentences with AD-related signs and symptoms based on the label definition. We train a system to detect AD-related signs and symptoms from EHRs. We find that the silver and bronze datasets improves the system performance, outperforming the system using only the gold dataset. This shows that LLMs can generate synthetic clinical data for a complex task by incorporating expert knowledge, and our label-to-data method can produce datasets that are free of sensitive information, while maintaining acceptable quality.",

        "AbstractText": "To assess the experience of families and clinicians at a long term acute care hospital (LTACH) after implementing a written communication intervention. Written communication templates were developed for six clinical disciplines. LTACH clinicians used templates to describe the condition of 30 mechanically ventilated patients at up to three time points. Completed templates were the basis for written summaries that were sent to families. Impressions of the intervention among families (n\u00a0=\u00a021) and clinicians (n\u00a0=\u00a017) were assessed using a descriptive correlational design. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. We identified four themes during interviews with families: Written summaries 1) facilitated communication with LTACH staff, 2) reduced stress related to COVID-19 visitor restrictions, 3) facilitated understanding of the patient condition, prognosis, and goals and 4) facilitated communication among family members. Although clinicians understood why families would appreciate written material, they did not feel that the intervention addressed their main challenge - overly optimistic expectations for patient recovery among families. Written communication positively affected the experience of families of LTACH patients, but was less useful for clinicians. Use of written patient care updates helps LTACH clinicians initiate communication with families.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a persistent neuropathological injury that manifests via neuronal/synaptic death, age spot development, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. Synapsin 1 (SYN1), a neuronal phosphoprotein, is believed to be responsible for the pathology of AD. This study aimed to elucidate the exact role of SYN1 in ameliorating AD and its potential regulatory mechanisms. The AD dataset GSE48350 was downloaded from the GEO database, and SYN1 was focused on differential expression analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. After establishing an AD rat model, they were treated with RNAi lentivirus to trigger SYN1 overexpression. The amelioration of SYN1 in AD-associated behavior was validated using multiple experiments (water maze test and object recognition test). SYN1's repairing effect on the important factors in AD was confirmed by detecting the concentration of inflammatory factors (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1), neurotransmitters (acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT)) and markers of oxidative stress (glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS)). Molecular biology experiments (qRT-PCR and western blot) were performed to examine AD-related signaling pathways after SYN1 overexpression. Differential expression analysis yielded a total of 545 differentially expressed genes, of which four were upregulated and 541 were downregulated. The enriched pathways were basically focused on synaptic functions, and the analysis of the protein- protein interaction network focused on the key genes in SYN1. SYN1 significantly improved the spatial learning and memory abilities of AD rats. This enhancement was reflected in the reduced escape latency of the rats in the water maze, the significantly extended dwell time in the third quadrant, and the increased number of crossings. Furthermore, the results of the object recognition test revealed reduced time for rats to explore familiar and new objects. After SYN1 overexpression, the cAMP signaling pathway was activated, the phosphorylation levels of the CREB and PKA proteins were elevated, and the secretion of neurotransmitters such as ACh, DA, and 5-HT was promoted. Furthermore, oxidative stress was suppressed, as supported by decreased levels of MDA and ROS. Regarding inflammatory factors, the levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly reduced in AD rats with SYN1 overexpression. SYN1 overexpression improves cognitive function and promotes the release of various neurotransmitters in AD rats by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through cAMP signaling pathway activation. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "To evaluate the potential beneficial role of Capsaicin in cognitive dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative damage induced by scopolamine in mice. Capsaicin is the chief phenolic component present in red chili and is responsible for its pungent and spicy flavor. It affects TRPV1 channels in nociceptive sensory neurons and is present in the hippocampus, and hypothalamus of the brains of rodents and humans. The main objective is to investigate the effective role of capsaicin in attenuating cognitive dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative damage induced by scopolamine in mice and examine the feasible mechanisms. Various doses of capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) were given orally to mice daily for 7 consecutive days after the administration of scopolamine. Various behavioral tests (motor coordination, locomotor counts, hole board test) and biochemical assay (Pro-inflammatory cytokines, catalase, lipid peroxidation, nitrite, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase), mitochondrial complex (I, II, III, and IV) enzyme activities, and mitochondrial permeability transition were evaluated in the distinct regions of the brain. Scopolamine-treated mice showed a considerable reduction in the entries and duration in the light zone as well as in open arms of the elevated plus maze. Interestingly, capsaicin at different doses reversed the anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and learning and memory impairment effects of scopolamine. Scopolamine-administered mice demonstrated substantially increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, impaired mitochondrial enzyme complex activities, and increased oxidative damage compared to the normal control group. Capsaicin treatment reinstated the reduced lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione activity, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and restoring mitochondrial complex enzyme activities (I, II, III, and IV) as well as mitochondrial permeability. Moreover, the IL-1\u03b2 level was restored at a dose of capsaicin (10 and 20 mg/kg) only. Capsaicin reduced the scopolamine-induced acetylcholinesterase activity, thereby raising the acetylcholine concentration in the hippocampal tissues of mice. Preservation of neuronal cell morphology was also confirmed by capsaicin in histological studies. From the above experimental results, capsaicin at a dose of 10 mg/kg, p.o. for seven consecutive days was found to be the most effective dose. The experiential neuroprotective effect of capsaicin through the restoration of mitochondrial functions, antioxidant effects, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines makes it a promising candidate for further drug development through clinical setup.",

Sixty SPF-grade male SD rats were randomized into a control group, a model group, a donepezil group, a BBPR group, and a SPR group, with twelve rats in each group. Other groups except the control group were administrated with D-galactose injection(100 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)) once a day for seven weeks. The control group was administrated with an equal volume of normal saline once a day for seven consecutive weeks. After three weeks of D-galactose injection, bilateral hippocampal A\u03b2_(25-35) injections were performed for modeling. The rats were administrated with corresponding drugs(10 mL\u00b7kg~(-1)) by gavage since week 2, and the rats in the model and control group with an equal volume of double distilled water once a day for 35 continuous days. The memory behaviour and pathological changes in the hippocampal tissue were observed. The untargeted metabolites in the urine were detected by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q/TOF-MS). Principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were employed to characterize and screen differential metabolites and potential biomarkers, for which the metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was conducted. The results indicated that BBPR and SPR increased the new object recognition index, shortened the escape latency, and increased the times of crossing the platform of AD rats in the Morris water maze test. The results of hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining showed that the cells in the hippocampal tissue of the drug administration groups were closely arranged. Moreover, the drugs reduced the content of interleukin-6(IL-6, P&lt;0.01) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) in the hippocampal tissue, which were more obvious in the BBPR group(P&lt;0.05). After screening, 15 potential biomarkers were identified, involving two metabolic pathways: dicoumarol pathway and piroxicam pathway. BBPR and SPR may alleviate AD by regulating the metabolism of dicoumarol and piroxicam.",

        "AbstractText": "Microbial communities in the intestinal tract are suggested to impact the ethiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The human microbiome might modulate neuroinflammatory processes and contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. However, the microbial compositions in patients with AD at different stages of the disease are still not fully characterized. We used 16S rRNA analyses to investigate the oral and fecal microbiota in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 84), at-risk individuals (APOE4 carriers; n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 50) and investigated the relationship of microbial communities and disease-specific markers via multivariate- and network-based approaches. We found a slightly decreased diversity in the fecal microbiota of patients with AD (average Chao1 diversity for AD = 212 [SD = 66]; for controls = 215 [SD = 55]) and identified differences in bacterial abundances including Bacteroidetes, Ruminococcus, Sutterella, and Porphyromonadaceae. The diversity in the oral microbiota was increased in patients with AD and at-risk individuals (average Chao1 diversity for AD = 174 [SD = 60], for at-risk group = 195 [SD = 49]). Gram-negative proinflammatory bacteria including Haemophilus, Neisseria, Actinobacillus, and Porphyromonas were dominant oral bacteria in patients with AD and MCI and the abundance correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker. Taken together, we observed a strong shift in the fecal and the oral communities of patients with AD already prominent in prodromal and, in case of the oral microbiota, in at-risk stages. This indicates stage-dependent alterations in oral and fecal microbiota in AD which may contribute to the pathogenesis via a facilitated intestinal and systemic inflammation leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein (apo) E4, being a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is actively involved in the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, the principle constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. ApoE4 is believed to affect APP processing through intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, whereas lowering the cholesterol level by pharmacological agents has been suggested to reduce A\u03b2 production. This study has investigated the effects of hypolipidemic agents fenofibrate, and the flavonoids-naringenin and diosmetin-on apoE4-induced APP processing in rat neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with human wild-type APP 695 (B103-hAPP695wt). B103-hAPP695wt cells were pretreated with different doses of flavonoids and fenofibrate for 1 h prior to apoE4 exposure for 24 h. ApoE4-induced production of intra- and extracellular A\u03b2 peptides has been reduced with fenofibrate, naringenin, and diosmetin treatments. Pretreatment with diosmetin has significantly reduced apoE4-induced full-length APP (fl- APP) expression, whereas naringenin and fenofibrate had no effect on it. In addition, the increase in the apoE4-induced secretion of sAPPtotal and sAPP\u03b1 has been dose-dependently reduced with drug pretreatment. On the other hand, the decrease in the expression of both APP-carboxy terminal fragments (CTF)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (generated by the \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP) by apoE4 was dose-dependently increased in cells pretreated with fenofibrate and naringenin but not diosmetin. Thus, we suggest that fenofibrate, naringenin, and diosmetin treatments can reduce apoE4- induced A\u03b2 production by distinct mechanisms that may prove useful in developing drugs for AD patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is a characteristic non-motor feature of Parkinson disease (PD) that poses a severe burden on the patients and caregivers, yet relatively little is known about its pathobiology. Cognitive deficits are evident throughout the course of PD, with around 25% of subtle cognitive decline and mild CI (MCI) at the time of diagnosis and up to 83% of patients developing dementia after 20 years. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neuropathological process, characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic striatonigral system and of many other neuronal systems, results not only in structural deficits but also extensive changes of functional neuronal network activities and neurotransmitter dysfunctions. Modern neuroimaging studies revealed multilocular cortical and subcortical atrophies and alterations in intrinsic neuronal connectivities. The decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) in the bilateral prefrontal cortex is affected already before the development of clinical CI and in the absence of structural changes. Longitudinal cognitive decline is associated with frontostriatal and limbic affections, white matter microlesions and changes between multiple functional neuronal networks, including thalamo-insular, frontoparietal and attention networks, the cholinergic forebrain and the noradrenergic system. Superimposed Alzheimer-related (and other concomitant) pathologies due to interactions between \u03b1-synuclein, tau-protein and \u03b2-amyloid contribute to dementia pathogenesis in both PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). To further elucidate the interaction of the pathomechanisms responsible for CI in PD, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted that are supported by fluid and sophisticated imaging biomarkers as a basis for better early diagnosis and future disease-modifying therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that ranks second in prevalence after Alzheimer's disease. The number of PD diagnoses increases annually. Nevertheless, modern PD treatments merely mitigate symptoms rather than preventing neurodegeneration progression. The creation of an appropriate model to thoroughly study the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis remains a current challenge in biomedicine. Recently, there has been an increase in data regarding the involvement of not only dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra but also astrocytes in the pathogenesis of PD. Cell models based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives are a useful tool for studying the contribution and interaction of these two cell types in PD. Here, we generated two iPSC lines, ICGi034-B and ICGi034-C, by reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient with a heterozygous mutation c.1226A>G (p.N370S) in the GBA1 gene by non-integrating episomal vectors encoding OCT4, KLF4, L-MYC, SOX2, LIN28, and mp53DD. The iPSC lines demonstrate the expression of pluripotency markers and are capable of differentiating into three germ layers. We differentiated the ICGi034-B and ICGi034-C iPSC lines into astrocytes. This resulting cell model can be used to study the involvement of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of GBA-associated PD.",

        "AbstractText": "According to numerous studies, it has been epidemiologically suggested that habitual coffee intake seems to prevent the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that coffee consumption suppresses neuroinflammation, which is closely related to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Using microglial BV-2 cells, we first found that the inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was diminished by both coffee and decaffeinated coffee through the inhibition of an inflammation-related transcription factor, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Pyrocatechol, a component of roasted coffee produced by the thermal decomposition of chlorogenic acid, also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB. Finally, in an inflammation model using mice injected with LPS into the cerebrum, we observed that intake of pyrocatechol as well as coffee decoctions drastically suppressed the accumulation of microglia and the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), CCL2, and CXCL1 in the inflammatory brain. These observations strongly encourage us to hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory activity of pyrocatechol as well as coffee decoction would be useful for the suppression of neurodegeneration and the prevention of the onsets of Alzheimer's (AD) and Perkinson's diseases (PD).",

        "AbstractText": "Tagetes erecta is an edible flower deeply rooted in traditional Mexican culture. It holds a central role in the most popular and iconic Mexican celebration, \"the Day of the Dead\". Furthermore, it is currently receiving interest as a potential therapeutic agent, motivated mainly by its polyphenol content. The present study aims to evaluate the biological activity of an extract synthesized from the petals of the edible flower T. erecta. This extract showed significant antioxidant scores measured by the most common in vitro methodologies (FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH), with values of 1475.3 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, 1950.3 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, and 977.7 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, respectively. In addition, up to 36 individual polyphenols were identified by chromatography. Regarding the biomedical aspects of the petal extract, it exhibited antitumoral activity against ovarian carcinoma cells evaluated by the MTS assay, revealing a lower value of IC50 compared to other flower extracts. For example, the extract from T. erecta reported an IC50 value half as low as an extract from Rosa \u00d7 hybrida and six times lower than another extract from Tulbaghia violacea. This antitumoral effect of T. erecta arises from the induction of the apoptotic process; thus, incubating ovarian carcinoma cells with the petal extract increased the rate of apoptotic cells measured by flow cytometry. Moreover, the extract also demonstrated efficacy as a therapeutic agent against tauopathy, a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Caenorhabditis elegans experimental model. Treating worms with the experimental extract prevented disfunction in several motility parameters such as wavelength and swimming speed. Furthermore, the T. erecta petal extract prevented the release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are associated with the progression of AD. Thus, treatment with the extract resulted in an approximate 20% reduction in ROS production. These findings suggest that these petals could serve as a suitable source of polyphenols for biomedical applications.",

        "AbstractText": "This review describes associations between dementia and loneliness on the neurobiological and epidemiological levels according to the recent body of literature. The aim of this study was to highlight major lines of research in this field. Sociocognitive skills and social interactions present complex interdependencies with dementia which may be explained by two theories. According to the first one, not sufficiently engaging in social or cognitive activities results in brain atrophy. The second one claims that brain neurogenesis and synaptic density are being increased by social connections. The relationship between loneliness and dementia could be mediated by sensory loss, including hearing and visual impairment, as well as depression and psychotic symptoms. Loneliness itself might cause a depletion in sensory and cognitive stimulation which results in a decrease in neural reserve. Certain changes in the structures of the brain caused by loneliness were found in imaging examination. Loneliness appears to be a crucial risk factor for dementia in recent times due to the modern lifestyle and consequences of the outbreak of COVID-19. Additional studies are required to understand more completely the key tenets of this topic and therefore to improve the prevention and treatment of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "After several years of research in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is still unclear how amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and Tau, two key hallmarks of the disease, mediate the neuropathogenic events that lead to AD. Current data challenge the \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" that has prevailed in the field of AD, stating that A\u03b2 precedes and triggers Tau pathology that will eventually become the toxic entity in the progression of the disease. This perspective also led the field of therapeutic approaches towards the development of strategies that target A\u03b2 or Tau. In the present review, we discuss recent literature regarding the neurotoxic role of both A\u03b2 and Tau in AD, as well as their physiological function in the healthy brain. Consequently, we present studies suggesting that A\u03b2 and Tau act independently of each other in mediating neurotoxicity in AD, thereafter, re-evaluating the \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" that places Tau pathology downstream of A\u03b2. More recent studies have confirmed that both A\u03b2 and Tau could propagate the disease and induce synaptic and memory impairments via the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This finding is not only interesting from a mechanistic point of view since it provides better insights into the AD pathogenesis but also from a therapeutic point of view since it renders APP a common downstream effector for both A\u03b2 and Tau. Subsequently, therapeutic strategies that act on APP might provide a more viable and physiologically relevant approach for targeting AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and has a high incidence in the elderly. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for AD owing to its complicated pathogenesis. However, the development of lipid-lowering anti-inflammatory drugs has heralded a new era in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Several studies in recent years have shown that lipid metabolic dysregulation and neuroinflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of AD. 3-Hydroxyl 3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis that plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism. HMGCR inhibitors, known as statins, have changed from being solely lipid-lowering agents to neuroprotective compounds because of their effects on lipid levels and inflammation. In this review, we first summarize the main regulatory mechanism of HMGCR affecting cholesterol biosynthesis. We also discuss the pathogenesis of AD induced by HMGCR, including disordered lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, microglial proliferation, and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition. Subsequently, we explain the possibility of HMGCR as a potential target for AD treatment. Statins-based AD treatment is an ascent field and currently quite controversial; therefore, we also elaborate on the current application prospects and limitations of statins in AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) relies on clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Reliable biomarkers are needed to differentiate MS from other neurological conditions and to define the underlying pathogenesis. This study aimed to comprehensively profile immune activation biomarkers in the CSF of individuals with MS and explore distinct signatures between MS with and without oligoclonal bands (OCB). A total of 118 subjects, including relapsing-remitting MS with OCB (MS OCB+) (n = 58), without OCB (MS OCB-) (n = 24), and controls with other neurological diseases (OND) (n = 36), were included. CSF samples were analyzed by means of proximity extension assay (PEA) for quantifying 92 immune-related proteins. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of axonal damage, was also measured. Machine learning techniques were employed to identify biomarker panels differentiating MS with and without OCB from controls. Analyses were performed by splitting the cohort into a training and a validation set. CSF CD5 and IL-12B exhibited the highest discriminatory power in differentiating MS from controls. CSF MIP-1-alpha, CD5, CXCL10, CCL23 and CXCL9 were positively correlated with NfL. Multivariate models were developed to distinguish MS OCB+ and MS OCB- from controls. The model for MS OCB+ included IL-12B, CD5, CX3CL1, FGF-19, CST5, MCP-1 (91% sensitivity and 94% specificity in the training set, 81% sensitivity, and 94% specificity in the validation set). The model for MS OCB- included CX3CL1, CD5, NfL, CCL4 and OPG (87% sensitivity and 80% specificity in the training set, 56% sensitivity and 48% specificity in the validation set). Comprehensive immune profiling of CSF biomarkers in MS revealed distinct pathophysiological signatures associated with OCB status. The identified biomarker panels, enriched in T cell activation markers and immune mediators, hold promise for improved diagnostic accuracy and insights into MS pathogenesis.",

In this review, we provide a general overview of lipid biology, provide examples of abnormal lysosomal lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss how these insights might offer novel and promising opportunities in biomarker development and therapeutic discovery.

KBs, generated through ketogenesis in the liver, are metabolized into acetyl-CoA in extrahepatic tissues, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain for ATP production. Reduced glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with increased neuronal death and brain damage during cerebral ischemia and neurodegeneration. Both KBs and the ketogenic diet (KD) demonstrate neuroprotective effects by orchestrating various cellular processes through metabolic and signaling functions. They enhance mitochondrial function, mitigate oxidative stress and apoptosis, and regulate epigenetic and post-translational modifications of histones and non-histone proteins. Additionally, KBs and KD contribute to reducing neuroinflammation and modulating autophagy, neurotransmission systems, and gut microbiome. This review aims to explore the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD against brain damage in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "A pathogenic mutation in presenilin-1 (PSEN1), His214Asn, was found in a male patient with memory decline at the age of 41 in Korea for the first time. The proband patient was associated with a positive family history from his father, paternal aunt, and paternal grandmother without genetic testing. He was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN1 His214Asn was initially reported in an Italian family, where the patient developed phenotypes similar to the current proband patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a mild hippocampal atrophy. The amyloid positron emission tomography (amyloid-PET) was positive, along with the positive test results of the increased amyloid \u00df (A\u03b2) oligomerization tendency with blood. The PSEN1 His214 amino acid position plays a significant role in the gamma-secretase function, especially from three additional reported mutations in this residue: His214Asp, His214Tyr, and His214Arg. The structure prediction model revealed that PSEN1 protein His214 may interact with Trp215 of His-Trp cation-\u03c0 interaction, and the mutations of His214 would destroy this interaction. The His-Trp cation-\u03c0 interaction between His214 and Trp215 would play a crucial structural role in stabilizing the 4th transmembrane domain of PSEN1 protein, especially when aromatic residues were often reported in the membrane interface of the lipid-extracellular region of alpha helices or beta sheets. The His214Asn would alter the cleavage dynamics of gamma-secretase from the disappeared interactions between His214 and Trp215 inside of the helix, resulting in elevated amyloid production. Hence, the increased A\u03b2 was reflected in the increased A\u03b2 oligomerization tendency and the accumulations of A\u03b2 in the brain from amyloid-PET, leading to EOAD.",

According to the amyloid hypothesis, any agent that has the capability to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and/or destroy amyloid plaques represents a potential disease-modifying drug.

These pathways are critical to the processes of neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, which are hallmarks of GBM and AD. We concentrate on the multifaceted regulation of TAMs by NF-\u03baB signaling in GBM, the influence of TREM2 on DAMs' responses to amyloid-beta deposition, and the modulation of both TAMs and DAMs by GBM- and AD-related miRNAs. Incorporating recent advancements in molecular biology, immunology, and AI techniques, through a detailed exploration of these molecular mechanisms, we aim to shed light on their distinct and overlapping regulatory functions in GBM and AD. The review culminates with a discussion on how insights into NF-\u03baB, miRNAs, and TREM2 signaling may inform novel therapeutic approaches targeting microglia and macrophages in these neurodegenerative and neoplastic conditions.

However, the specific mechanism by which Osthole alleviates dysmnesia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of Osthole against cognitive impairment in rats induced by D-galactose and elucidate its pharmacological mechanism. The rat model was established by subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 56 days. The effect of Osthole on cognitive impairment was evaluated by behavior and biochemical analysis. Subsequently, a combination of in silico prediction and experimental validation was performed to verify the network-based predictions, using western blot, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrate that Osthole could improve memory dysfunction induced by D-galactose in Sprague Dawley male rats. A network proximity-based approach and integrated pathways analysis highlight two key AD-related pathological processes that may be regulated by Osthole, including neuronal apoptosis, i.e., neuroinflammation. Among them, the pro-apoptotic markers (Bax), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), the microgliosis (Iba-1), Astro-cytosis (GFAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-R1) were evaluated in both hippocampus and cortex. The results indicated that Osthole significantly ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment rats. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the pharmacological mechanism of Osthole in mitigating D-galactose-induced memory impairment and identifies Osthole as a potential drug candidate for AD treatment, targeting multiple signaling pathways through network proximity and integrated pathways analysis.",

This involves dietary guidance, swallowing rehabilitation, and surgery in cases in which improvement with rehabilitation is inadequate. Surgery may involve altering certain pharyngolaryngeal structures to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration (swallowing improvement surgery) or separating the airway and digestive tract while sacrificing laryngeal function, with the main goal of preventing aspiration (aspiration prevention surgery).

Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Besides its role in coagulation, vitamin K seems to be involved in various other mechanisms, including inflammation and age-related diseases, also at the level of gene expression. This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a \"first-line\" model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.",

The potential inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 with pharmacological strategies paves the way for preventing AD and improving cognitive function in people at risk for dementia. We conducted a narrative review to characterize the evidence in relation to the involvement of TNF-\u03b1 in AD and its possible therapeutic inhibition. Several studies report that patients with RA and systemic inflammatory diseases treated with TNF-\u03b1 blocking agents reduce the probability of emerging dementia compared with the general population. Animal model studies also showed interesting results and are discussed. An increasing amount of basic scientific data and clinical studies underscore the importance of inflammatory processes and subsequent glial activation in the pathogenesis of AD. TNF-\u03b1 targeted therapy is a biologically plausible approach for cognition preservation and further trials are necessary to investigate the potential benefits of therapy in populations at risk of developing AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide and yet remains without effective therapy. Amongst the many proposed causes of AD, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis is gaining attention. Accumulating evidence shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is a driving force behind synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD patients. However, therapies targeting the mitochondria in AD have proven unsuccessful so far, and out-of-the-box options, such as hibernation-derived mitochondrial mechanisms, may provide valuable new insights. Hibernators uniquely and rapidly alternate between suppression and re-activation of the mitochondria while maintaining a sufficient energy supply and without acquiring ROS damage. Here, we briefly give an overview of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, how it affects synaptic function, and why mitochondrial targeting in AD has remained unsuccessful so far. We then discuss mitochondria in hibernation and daily torpor in mice, covering current advancements in hibernation-derived mitochondrial targeting strategies. We conclude with new ideas on how hibernation-derived dual mitochondrial targeting of both the ATP and ROS pathways may boost mitochondrial health and induce local synaptic protein translation to increase synaptic function and plasticity. Further exploration of these mechanisms may provide more effective treatment options for AD in the future.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[Correction of gut dysbiosis as a promising direction in the prevention of neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment].",
        "AbstractText": "In recent years new data have been obtained on the role of intestinal dysbiosis in the pathogenesis mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as on the influence of dietary patterns (Mediterranean diet, MIND diet) and probiotics on the correction of dysbiosis and slowing down the development of cognitive disorders. It seems reasonable to draw the attention of practicing physicians to the need to prevent cognitive dysfunction through dietary correction, probiotics and prebiotics intake. The purpose of the research was to study the possibility of using certain dietary patterns, as well as intake of probiotics and prebiotics for the correction of dysbiosis and early prevention of cognitive dysfunction, basing on the analysis of published data on the bidirectional communication between the colon microbiota and the brain and microbiota changes in patients with cognitive dysfunction and AD. Material and methods. We searched domestic and foreign literature devoted to gut microbiota, the \"gut-brain\" axis, microbiota disorders in AD patients; mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration; the role of dietary patterns, in particular MIND diet, pre- and probiotics in the prevention of cognitive dysfunction - via PubMed search engine, SemanticScholar Google Internet search platform and domestic scientific electronic library Cyberleninka. 72 literature sources were analyzed. Results. Intestinal dysbiosis and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Changes in the microbiota in patients with cognitive impairment and AD are associated with disease severity and are generally characterized by increased numbers of Gram-negative microorganisms in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla and decreased numbers of Gram-positive microorganisms in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla. An increase in gram-negative microorganisms abundance leads to elevated release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that disrupt the integrity of the intestinal mucous barrier and, through a series of steps, initiate neuroinflammation. Course application of probiotics containing representatives of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, in particular, Bifidobacterium breve A1 \u0438 Lactobacillus plantarum \u042129 strains, leads to improved cognitive function, which can be explained by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Long-term prospective studies of the effects of dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet clearly show delayed regression of cognitive function in older adults without initial dementia as well as in patients with AD. For example, according to various studies, individuals who have strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet for 6-9 years have a 23-39% lower risk of developing cognitive impairment. Adherence to the MIND diet for 6 years has a statistically significant association with higher verbal memory scores. Correction of gut dysbiosis, including through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics and bringing the diet to the MIND diet pattern, is the most affordable and rational method for early prevention of cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion. A promising strategy in the early prevention of neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment and dementia is to maintain the balance of the gut microbiota. The solution to this problem is achieved by adjusting the dietary pattern, increasing the use of dietary fiber and prebiotics and reasonable use of probiotics.",

        "AbstractText": "DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic mark with essential roles in disease development and predisposition. Here, we created genome-wide maps of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) in three peripheral tissues and used Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the potential causal relationships between DNAm and risk for two common neurodegenerative disorders, i.e. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; ~5.5M sites) and DNAm (~850K CpG sites) data were generated from whole blood (n=1,058), buccal (n=1,527) and saliva (n=837) specimens. We identified between 11 and 15 million genome-wide significant (p<10-14) SNP-CpG associations in each tissue. Combining these meQTL GWAS results with recent AD/PD GWAS summary statistics by MR strongly suggests that the previously described associations between PSMC3, PICALM, and TSPAN14 and AD may be founded on differential DNAm in or near these genes. In addition, there is strong, albeit less unequivocal, support for causal links between DNAm at PRDM7 in AD as well as at KANSL1/MAPT in AD and PD. Our study adds valuable insights on AD/PD pathogenesis by combining two high-resolution \"omics\" domains, and the meQTL data shared along with this publication will allow like-minded analyses in other diseases.",

The purpose of this analysis was to quantify the costs at a single site with a large catchment area of the Moderate-Intensity Exercise Versus High-Intensity Interval Training to Recover Walking Post-Stroke, HIT Stroke Trial. To determine cost, study expense reports were gathered and divided into four categories: oversight, recruitment, retention, and outcome assessments. Categories were then further divided into chronological order for initial contact and prescreening, consenting, initial screening, and baseline testing. The 12-week intervention was divided into 4-week blocks: intervention block 1, post 4-week outcome testing, intervention block 2, post 8-week outcome testing, intervention block 3, and post 12-week outcome testing. Total direct cost for site execution was $539,768 with cost per participant approximated as $35,984. Oversight costs accounted for 65.8% of the budget at $355,661. To achieve goals related to inclusive participant recruitment ($21,923) and retention ($28,009), our site costs totaled $49,932. Direct study-related costs included screening assessments ($5,905), baseline assessments ($15,028), intervention ($76,952), and outcome assessments ($36,288). Clinical trials on walking rehabilitation and exercise, especially those involving multiple assessment visits, require intensive oversight.

        "AbstractText": "In preclinical research on Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, tau phosphorylation analysis is routinely employed in both cellular and animal models. However, recognizing the sensitivity of tau phosphorylation to various extrinsic factors, notably temperature, is vital for experimental accuracy. Hypothermia can trigger tau hyperphosphorylation, while hyperthermia leads to its dephosphorylation. Nevertheless, the rapidity of tau phosphorylation in response to unintentional temperature variations remains unknown. In cell cultures, the most significant temperature change occurs when the cells are removed from the incubator before harvesting, and in animal models, during anesthesia prior to euthanasia. In this study, we investigate the kinetics of tau phosphorylation in N2a and SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines, as well as in mice exposed to anesthesia. We observed changes in tau phosphorylation within the few seconds upon transferring cell cultures from their 37\u00b0C incubator to room temperature conditions. However, cells placed directly on ice post-incubation exhibited negligible phosphorylation changes. In vivo, isoflurane anesthesia rapidly resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation within the few seconds needed to lose the pedal withdrawal reflex in mice. These findings emphasize the critical importance of preventing temperature variation in researches focused on tau. To ensure accurate results, we recommend avoiding anesthesia before euthanasia and promptly placing cells on ice after removal from the incubator. By controlling temperature fluctuations, the reliability and validity of tau phosphorylation studies can be significantly enhanced.",

Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine A\u03b2-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of A\u03b2-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15\u00a0min) of A\u03b2-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0ng/mL). The application of this disruptive technology to the analysis of just 25\u00a0\u03bcL of the three types of clinical samples provides values concordant with the clinical values reported, thus confirming the potential of the MM approach to assist in the reliable, simple, fast, and affordable diagnosis of AD by determining A\u03b2-42.",

Hence, there is a need for high quality studies with sufficient follow-up time and data to account for reverse causality and confounding. We aimed to address this knowledge gap. This cohort study used individual participant data from The Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway. All current residents aged at least 20 years in the former Norwegian Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County were invited to participate in four decennial surveys: HUNT1 (1984-1986), HUNT2 (1995-1997), HUNT3 (2006-2008), and HUNT4 (2017-2019) with individuals aged at least 70 years included in a substudy, known as HUNT4 70+. Here, we report the findings of this substudy. HUNT4 70+ comprised 7135 participants who were assessed for dementia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 criteria and who had audiometry between 1996 and 1998. The primary objective was to investigate, with gold standard audiometric testing and dementia diagnostic assessment, whether hearing impairment was an independent risk factor for all-cause dementia. The secondary objective was to investigate if a risk also applied to Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia. We analysed the association using Poisson regression and adjusted for confounders. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04284384). At baseline, 1058 (15%) individuals had acquired hearing impairment with a hearing threshold of at least 25 decibel (dB) and, at follow-up, 1089 (15%) had dementia. In the total group, people with hearing impairment had a relative risk (RR) 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.09) per 10\u00a0dB increase in hearing thresholds. For individuals younger than 85 years at follow-up the RR was 1.12 (95% CI 1.05-1.21). Associations between hearing impairment and Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia were similar. There was no association for individuals aged at least 85 years. We found a moderate association between objectively measured hearing impairment and dementia in the younger age group (<85 years). The findings of no association in the older age group (\u226585 years) might be due to the competing risk of death. The present study adds to the literature showing that acquired hearing impairment is a risk for dementias over a period which is too long for reverse causation, and with thorough consideration of confounders.

Impairment of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and increasing neuronal stress. Therefore, investigating the basic mechanisms of how mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated is essential. Herein, we investigate the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a single sugar post-translational modification, in controlling mitochondrial stress-induced transcription factor Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response (ISRmt), in which the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 results in the translation of ATF4. We used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, a transgenic mouse model of AD, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and HeLa cell-lines to examine the effect of sustained O-GlcNAcase inhibition by Thiamet-G (TMG) on ISRmt using biochemical analyses. We show that TMG elevates ATF4 protein levels upon mitochondrial stress in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and HeLa cell-lines. An indirect downstream target of ATF4 mitochondrial chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75) is significantly elevated. Interestingly, knock-down of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc, in SH-SY5Y increases ATF4 protein and mRNA expression. Additionally, ATF4 target gene Activating Transcription Factor 5 (ATF5) is significantly elevated at both the protein and mRNA level. Brains isolated from TMG treated mice show elevated levels of ATF4 and GRP75. Importantly, ATF4 occupancy increases at the ATF5 promoter site in brains isolated from TMG treated mice suggesting that O-GlcNAc is regulating ATF4 targeted gene expression. Interestingly, ATF4 and GRP75 are not induced in TMG treated familial Alzheimer's Disease mice model. The same results are seen in a human in vitro model of AD. Together, these results indicate that in healthy conditions, O-GlcNAc regulates the ISRmt through regulating ATF4, while manipulating O-GlcNAc in AD has no effect on ISRmt.",

        "AbstractText": "Allopregnanolone (Allo) is a neurosteroid with pleiotropic action in the brain that includes neurogenesis, oligogenesis, human and rodent neural stem cell regeneration, increased glucose metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, improved cognitive function, and reduction of both inflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Because the breadth of Allo-induced responses requires activation of multiple systems of biology in the absence of an Allo-specific nuclear receptor, analyses were conducted in both neurons and astrocytes to identify unifying systems and signaling pathways. Mechanisms of Allo action were investigated in embryonic hippocampal neurons and astrocytes cultured in an Aging Model (AM) media. Cellular morphology, mitochondrial function, and transcriptomics were investigated followed by mechanistic pathway analyses. In hippocampal neurons, Allo significantly increased neurite outgrowth and synaptic protein expression, which were paralleled by upregulated synaptogenesis and long-term potentiation gene expression profiles. Mechanistically, Allo induced Ca2+/CREB signaling cascades. In parallel, Allo significantly increased maximal mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Complex IV activity while reducing oxidative stress, which required both the GABAA and L-type Ca2+ channels. In astrocytes, Allo increased ATP generation, mitochondrial function and dynamics while reducing oxidative stress, inflammasome indicators, and apoptotic signaling. Mechanistically, Allo regulation of astrocytic mitochondrial function required both the GABAA and L-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, Allo activated NRF1-TFAM signaling and increased the DRP1/OPA1 protein ratio, which led to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. Collectively, the cellular, mitochondrial, transcriptional, and pharmacological profiles provide evidence in support of calcium signaling as a unifying mechanism for Allo pleiotropic actions in the brain.",

        "AbstractText": "Gait is a potential diagnostic tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to arm movements during walking, and there is currently no consensus on gait asymmetry. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether arm motion and gait asymmetry could be utilized for identifying MCI and AD. In total, 102 middle-aged and elderly individuals were included in the final analysis and were assigned to the following three groups: AD (n = 27), MCI (n = 35), and a normal control group (n = 40). Gait and cognitive assessments were conducted for all participants. Gait detection included a single-task gait with free-speed walking and a dual-task gait with adding a cognitive task of successive minus seven to walking. Original gait parameters were collected using a wearable device featuring the MATRIX system 2.0. Gait parameters were shortened to several main gait domains through factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation. Subsequently, the extracted gait domains were used to differentiate the three groups, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated. Factor analysis of single-task gait identified five independent gait domains: rhythm symmetry, rhythm, pace asymmetry, arm motion, and variability. Factor analysis of the dual-task gait identified four gait domains: rhythm, variability, symmetry, and arm motion. During single-task walking, pace asymmetry was negatively correlated with MoCA scores and could distinguish between the AD group and the other two groups. Arm motion was not associated with MoCA scores, and did not exhibit adequate discrimination in either task. Currently, there is no reliable evidence suggesting that arm motion can be used to recognize AD or MCI. Gait asymmetry can serve as a potential gait marker for the auxiliary diagnosis of AD but not for MCI.",

The dynamical balance between excitation and inhibition is vital for adjusting neural input/output relationships in cortical networks and regulating the dynamic range of their responses to stimuli. To infer this balance using connectomics, we recently introduced a computational framework based on the Ising model, which was first developed to explain phase transitions in ferromagnets, and proposed a novel hybrid resting-state structural connectome (rsSC). Here, we show that a generative model based on the Kuramoto phase oscillator can be used to simulate static and dynamic functional connectomes (FC) with rsSC as the coupling weight coefficients, such that the simulated FC aligns well with the observed FC when compared with that simulated traditional structural connectome.",

Here we highlight the importance of microglia activation in neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting microglia for neurodegenerative disease treatment is a promising direction.

In this editorial, we discuss the various neuroimaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease that have been studied using 7T MRI, which include morphological alterations, molecular characterization of cerebral T2*-weighted hypointensities, the evaluation of cerebral microbleeds and microinfarcts, biochemical changes studied with MR spectroscopy, as well as some other approaches.

These proteins, which are evolutionarily conserved and crucial for synaptic vesicle priming and exocytosis, have been implicated in a range of disorders, spanning from neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) to immune-related conditions such as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). The involvement of UNC13A in neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity is linked to ALS and FTD, with genetic variations affecting disease progression. UNC13B, which is closely related to UNC13A, plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy, and schizophrenia. UNC13C is implicated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and has a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). UNC13D has an essential role in immune cell function, making it a key player in FHL. This review highlights the distinct molecular functions of each UNC13 family member and their implications in disease contexts, shedding light on potential therapeutic strategies and avenues for future research.

Thus, this review aims to explore how diet can potentially influence ALS onset and/or progression. In this review, five popular diets (Mediterranean, Vegan, Carnivore, Paleolithic and Ketogenic) and their distinct macromolecule composition, nutritional profile, biochemical pathways and their potential therapeutic effects for ALS are thoroughly examined. However, the composition of these diets varies, and the data is controversial, with conflicting studies on the effectiveness of nutrient intake of several of these diets. Although these five diets show that a higher intake of foods containing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds have a positive correlation towards reducing the oxidative stress of ALS, further research is needed to directly compare the effects of these diets and the mechanisms leading to ALS and its progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is defined by the presence of \u03b2-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles potentially preceding clinical symptoms by many years. Previously only detectable post-mortem, these pathological hallmarks are now identifiable using biomarkers, permitting an in vivo definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 18F-flortaucipir (previously known as 18F-T807; 18F-AV-1451) was the first tau positron emission tomography tracer to be introduced and is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved tau positron emission tomography tracer (Tauvid\u2122). It has been widely adopted and validated in a number of independent research and clinical settings. In this review, we present an overview of the published literature on flortaucipir for positron emission tomography imaging of neurofibrillary tau tangles. We considered all accessible peer-reviewed literature pertaining to flortaucipir through 30 April 2022. We found 474 relevant peer-reviewed publications, which were organized into the following categories based on their primary focus: typical Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and pre-symptomatic populations; atypical Alzheimer's disease; non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative conditions; head-to-head comparisons with other Tau positron emission tomography tracers; and technical considerations. The available flortaucipir literature provides substantial evidence for the use of this positron emission tomography tracer in assessing neurofibrillary tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease and limited support for its use in other neurodegenerative disorders. Visual interpretation and quantitation approaches, although heterogeneous, mostly converge and demonstrate the high diagnostic and prognostic value of flortaucipir in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called \"normal-appearing\" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.",

        "AbstractText": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein often found in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beyond this context, mounting evidence suggests that tau localizes into the nucleus, where it may play a role in DNA protection and heterochromatin regulation. Models of tau depletion or pathology show loss of genetically silent heterochromatin, aberrant expression of heterochromatic genes, and transposable element activation. The molecular mechanisms behind these observations are currently unclear. Using in vitro biophysical experiments, here we demonstrate that tau can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with DNA, mononucleosomes, and reconstituted nucleosome arrays under low salt conditions. Low concentrations of tau promote chromatin compaction and protect DNA from digestion. While the material state of samples at physiological salt is dominated by chromatin oligomerization, tau can still associate strongly and reversibly with nucleosome arrays. These properties are driven by tau's strong interactions with linker and nucleosomal DNA, while magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments show that tau binding does not drastically alter nucleosome structure and dynamics. In addition, tau co-localizes into droplets formed by nucleosome arrays and phosphorylated HP1\u03b1, a key heterochromatin constituent thought to function through an LLPS mechanism. Importantly, LLPS and chromatin interactions are disrupted by aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. These biophysical properties suggest that tau may directly impact DNA and chromatin accessibility and that loss of these interactions could contribute to the aberrant nuclear effects seen in tau pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "Pupil dynamics has emerged as a critical non-invasive indicator of brain state changes. In particular, pupillary-light-responses (PLR) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may be used as biomarkers of brain degeneration. To characterize AD-specific PLR and its underlying neuromodulatory sources, we combined high-resolution awake mouse fMRI with real-time pupillometry to map brain-wide event-related correlation patterns based on illumination-driven pupil constriction ( P c ) and post-illumination pupil dilation recovery (amplitude, P d , and time, T ). The P c -driven differential analysis revealed altered visual signal processing coupled with reduced thalamocortical activation in AD mice compared with the wild-type normal mice. In contrast, the post-illumination pupil dilation recovery-based fMRI highlighted multiple brain areas related to AD brain degeneration, including the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, septal area of the basal forebrain, medial raphe nucleus, and pontine reticular nuclei (PRN). Also, brain-wide functional connectivity analysis highlighted the most significant changes in PRN of AD mice, which serves as the major subcortical relay nuclei underlying oculomotor function. This work combined non-invasive pupil-fMRI measurements in preclinical models to identify pupillary biomarkers based on neuromodulatory dysfunction coupled with AD brain degeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Exosomes are proposed to be important in the pathogenesis of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. We report the first application of solid-state technology to perform multiplex analysis of single exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the lumbar sac of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD, n=30) or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD, n=30), as well as age-matched health controls (HCN, n=30). Single events were captured with mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of three different tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, or CD81) or with mouse (M) IgG control, and then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies to prion protein (PrP) or CD47 to mark neuronal or presynaptic origin, as well as ADD- and PDD-related proteins: amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein, and Apolipoprotein (Apo) E. Data were collected only from captured events that were within the size range of 50 to 200 nm. Exosomes were present at approximately 100 billion per mL human CSF and were similarly abundant for CD9+ and CD81+ events, but CD63+ were only 22% to 25% of CD9+ (P<0.0001) or CD81+ (P<0.0001) events. Approximately 24% of CSF exosomes were PrP+, while only 2% were CD47+. The vast majority of exosomes were surface ApoE+, and the number of PrP-ApoE+ (P<0.001) and PrP+ApoE+ (P<0.01) exosomes were significantly reduced in ADD vs. HCN for CD9+ events only. A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-synuclein were not detected on the exosome surface or in permeabilized cargo. These data provide new insights into single exosome molecular features and highlight reduction in the CSF concentration of ApoE+ exosomes in patients with ADD.",

METHODS: We investigated differences of serum and brain metabolites between the early-onset 5XFAD and late-onset LOAD1 (APOE4.Trem2*R47H) mouse models of AD to C57BL/6J controls at six months of age. We identified sex differences for several classes of metabolites, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and amino acids. Metabolic signatures were notably different between brain and serum in both mouse models. The 5XFAD mice exhibited stronger differences in brain metabolites, whereas LOAD1 mice showed more pronounced differences in serum. Several of our findings were consistent with results in humans, showing glycerophospholipids reduction in serum of APOE4 carriers and replicating the serum metabolic imprint of the APOE4 genotype.

        "AbstractText": "Sleep-wake scoring is a time-consuming, tedious but essential component of clinical and pre-clinical sleep research. Sleep scoring is even more laborious and challenging in rodents due to the smaller EEG amplitude differences between states and the rapid state transitions which necessitate scoring in shorter epochs. Although many automated rodent sleep scoring methods exist, they do not perform as well when scoring new data sets, especially those which involve changes in the EEG/EMG profile. Thus, manual scoring by expert scorers remains the gold-standard. Here we take a different approach to this problem by using a neural network to accelerate the scoring of expert scorers. Sleep-Deep-Net (SDN) creates a bespoke deep convolution neural network model for individual electroencephalographic or local-field-potential records via transfer learning of GoogleNet, by learning from a small subset of manual scores of each EEG/LFP record as provided by the end-user. SDN then automates scoring of the remainder of the EEG/LFP record. A novel REM scoring correction procedure further enhanced accuracy. SDN reliably scores EEG and LFP data and retains sleep-wake architecture in wild-type mice, in sleep induced by the hypnotic zolpidem, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in a genetic knock-down study, when compared to manual scoring. SDN reduced manual scoring time to 1/12. Since SDN uses transfer learning on each independent recording, it is not biased by previously scored existing data sets. Thus, we find SDN performs well when used on signals altered by a drug, disease model or genetic modification.",

        "AbstractText": "Di-valent short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising therapeutic modality that enables sequence-specific modulation of a single target gene in the central nervous system (CNS). To treat complex neurodegenerative disorders, where pathogenesis is driven by multiple genes or pathways, di-valent siRNA must be able to silence multiple target genes simultaneously. Here we present a framework for designing unimolecular \"dual-targeting\" di-valent siRNAs capable of co-silencing two genes in the CNS. We reconfigured di-valent siRNA - in which two identical, linked siRNAs are made concurrently - to create linear di-valent siRNA - where two siRNAs are made sequentially attached by a covalent linker. This linear configuration, synthesized using commercially available reagents, enables incorporation of two different siRNAs to silence two different targets. We demonstrate that this dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is fully functional in the CNS of mice, supporting at least two months of maximal target silencing. Dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is highly programmable, enabling simultaneous modulation of two different disease-relevant gene pairs (e.g., Huntington's disease: MSH3 and HTT; Alzheimer's disease: APOE and JAK1) with similar potency to a mixture of single-targeting di-valent siRNAs against each gene. This work potentiates CNS modulation of virtually any pair of disease-related targets using a simple unimolecular siRNA.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging and sex are major risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer's disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development. We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 (WT) control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain, liver, spleen, and plasma samples (n=3-8 mice per sex, strain, and age group). We performed histological analyses on all tissues and assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, as well as splenic mass and morphology. Additionally, we measured concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer's and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study in each sex. 3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer's neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and next to no Alzheimer's neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, further suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Clinical investigations revealed that 3xTg-AD brain aging phenotypes are not an artifact of the animal model, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in canonical pathways related to neuronal signaling and immune function. Interestingly, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs in diseased males of both species. Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease trajectories. We propose a model of disease pathogenesis in 3xTg-AD males in which aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger an inflammatory response, mimicking the effects of LPS stimulation despite the absence of infection.",

This is particularly significant in individuals who already have Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the cognitive impairments can be more pronounced in these cases. However, the extent and underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairments in COVID-19-infected AD patients have yet to be fully investigated through clinical and neurophysiological approaches. This study included a total of 77 AD patients. Cognitive functions were assessed using neuropsychiatric scales for all participants, and plasma biomarkers of amyloid protein and tau protein were measured in a subset of 25 participants. To investigate the changes in functional brain connectivity induced by COVID-19 infection, a cross-sectional neuroimaging design was conducted involving a subset of 37 AD patients, including a control group of 18 AD participants without COVID-19 infection and a COVID-19 group consisting of 19 AD participants. For the 77\u2009AD patients between the stages of pre and post COVID-19 infection, there were significant differences in cognitive function and psychobehavioral symptoms on the Montreal Scale (MoCA), the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), the clinician's global impression of change (CIBIC-Plus), and the activity of daily living scale (ADL). The COVID-19 infection significantly decreased the plasma biomarker level of A\u03b242 and increased the plasma p-tau181 level in AD patients. The COVID-19-infected AD patients show decreased local coherence (LCOR) in the anterior middle temporal gyrus and decreased global correlation (GCOR) in the precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest clinical, cognitive, and neural alterations following COVID-19 infection in AD patients and emphasize the need for close monitoring of symptoms in AD patients who have had COVID-19 and further exploration of the underlying mechanisms.",

        "AbstractText": "Current evidence suggests that microvessel disease is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrovascular disease correlates with cardiovascular disease and is complicated in \u224840% of AD patients. The protein kinase C (PKC) \u03b5 activator DCPLA can stimulate human antigen (Hu) R that prevents degradation and promotes the translation of mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) mRNAs. To induce brain microinfarcts, we injected triple transgenic (3\u00d7Tg) and wild-type (WT) control mice with microbeads (20\u2009\u03bcm caliber) into common carotid arteries, with or without the DCPLA-ME (methyl-ester) for 2\u2009weeks. After water maze training, mice at 16\u2009months old were examined for confocal immunohistochemistry at a single cell or microvessel level in the hippocampal CA1 area, important for spatial memory storage, and in the dorsal hippocampus by western blots. In 3\u00d7Tg mice without cerebral microinfarcts, an accelerating age-related increase in (mild) oxidative stress and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, but a reduction in VEGF, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and MnSOD were associated with capillary loss. The change was less pronounced in arterioles. However, in 3\u00d7Tg mice with cerebral microinfarcts, increasing arteriolar diameter and their wall cells were related with the strong oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3), and sustained hypoxia (increased HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF/PKC\u03b5/extracellular signal regulated kinase or ERK pathway). Microocclusion enhanced the loss of the synaptic marker spinophilin, astrocytic number, and astrocyte-vascular coupling areas and demyelination of axons. DCPLA-ME prevented spatial memory defect; strong oxidative stress-related apoptosis; sustained hypoxia (by reducing HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF); and exaggerated cell repair in arteriolar walls, pericapillary space dilation, neuro-glial-vascular disruption, and demyelination. In conclusion, in 3\u00d7Tg mice with cerebral microinfarcts, sustained hypoxia (increased HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF signals) is dominant with arteriolar wall thickening, and DCPLA has a protective effect on sustained hypoxia.",

Urine is more convenient which could reflect the change of disease at an earlier stage. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate novel diagnostic panels. We first enrolled participants from China-Japan Friendship Hospital from April 2022 to November 2022, collected urine samples and conducted an LC-MS/MS analysis. In parallel, clinical data were collected and clinical examinations were performed. After statistical and bioinformatics analyzes, significant risk factors and differential urinary metabolites were determined. We attempt to investigate diagnostic panels based on machine learning including LASSO and SVM. Fifty-seven AD patients, 43 MCI patients and 62 CN subjects were enrolled. A total of 2,140 metabolites were identified among which 125 significantly differed between the AD and CN groups, including 46 upregulated ones and 79 downregulated ones. In parallel, there were 93 significant differential metabolites between the MCI and CN groups, including 23 upregulated ones and 70 downregulated ones. AD diagnostic panel (30 metabolites+ age\u2009+\u2009APOE) achieved an AUC of 0.9575 in the test set while MCI diagnostic panel (45 metabolites+ age\u2009+\u2009APOE) achieved an AUC of 0.7333 in the test set.

The neuroprotective effect of andrographolide (AGA) has been confirmed, anda acetylated derivative of AGA (3,14,19-triacetylandrographolide, ADA) was considered to have stronger efficacy. The current study aims to investigate the impact of ADA on cognitive ability in a sporadic AD model and explore its potential mechanism. Apoe4 mouse was adopted for evaluating the impact of AGA on cognitive impairment through a serious of behavioral tests. The molecular mechanism of ADA involved in mitophagy and neuroinflammation was investigated in detailby Western blot, ELISA, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy in Apoe4 mice, as well as Apoe4-transfected BV2 cells and HT22 cells. ADA application significantly improved cognitive impairment of Apoe4 mice, and lessened A\u03b2 load and neuronal damage, which has stronger activity than its prototype AGA. Accumulated mitophagy markers LC3II, P62, TOM20, PINK1 and Parkin, and decreased mitophagy receptor BNIP3 in hippocampus of Apoe4 mice were greatly reversed after ADA treatment. Meanwhile, ADA promoted the recruitment of BNIP3 to mitochondria, and the transport of damaged mitochondria to lysosome, indicating that disturbed mitophagy in AD mice was restored by ADA. Inhibited SIRT3 and FOXO3a in Apoe4 mice brains were elevated after ADA treatment. ADA also lightened the neuroinflammation caused by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Additionally, damaged mitophagy and/or activated NLRP3 inflammasome were also observed in BV2 cells and HT22 cells transfected with Apoe4, all of which were rescued by ADA incubation. Noteworthily, SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP could abolish the impact of ADA on mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro. ADA exerted stronger cognition-enhancing ability in relative to AGA, and ADA could repaire mitophagy deficiency via SIRT3-FOXO3a pathway, and subsequently inhibite NLRP3 inflammasome to mitigate AD pathology.",

Here we investigated in APP/PS1 mice by ovariectomy (OVX) and estradiol (E2) supplementation or inhibition of LH the effect on hippocampus-related cognition and related molecular changes. We found that OVX-associated cognitive impairment was accompanied by increased dorsal hippocampal EGR1 expression, which was rescued by downregulating peripheral LH rather than by supplementing E2. We also found in postmortem AD brains a higher expression of pituitary LH-mRNA and higher EGR1 expression in the posterior hippocampus. Both, in human and mice, there was a significant positive correlation between respectively posterior/dorsal hippocampal EGR1 and peripheral LH expression.

        "ArticleTitle": "How word semantics and phonology affect handwriting of Alzheimer's patients: A machine learning based analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Using kinematic properties of handwriting to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease is a real challenge: non-invasive detection techniques combined with machine learning approaches promise big steps forward in this research field. In literature, the tasks proposed focused on different cognitive skills to elicitate handwriting movements. In particular, the meaning and phonology of words to copy can compromise writing fluency. In this paper, we investigated how word semantics and phonology affect the handwriting of people affected by Alzheimer's disease. To this aim, we used the data from six handwriting tasks, each requiring copying a word belonging to one of the following categories: regular (have a predictable phoneme-grapheme correspondence, e.g., cat), non-regular (have atypical phoneme-grapheme correspondence, e.g., laugh), and non-word (non-meaningful pronounceable letter strings that conform to phoneme-grapheme conversion rules). We analyzed the data using a machine learning approach by implementing four well-known and widely-used classifiers and feature selection. The experimental results showed that the feature selection allowed us to derive a different set of highly distinctive features for each word type. Furthermore, non-regular words needed, on average, more features but achieved excellent classification performance: the best result was obtained on a non-regular, reaching an accuracy close to 90%.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Neuroprotective potentials of Lead phytochemicals against Alzheimer's disease with focus on oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathways: Pharmacokinetic challenges, target specificity, clinical trials and future perspectives.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and dementia are among the highly prevalent neurological disorders characterized by deposition of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques, dense deposits of highly phosphorylated tau proteins, insufficiency of acetylcholine (ACh) and imbalance in glutamatergic system. Patients typically experience cognitive, behavioral alterations and are unable to perform their routine activities. Evidence also suggests that inflammatory processes including excessive microglia activation, high expression of inflammatory cytokines and release of free radicals. Thus, targeting inflammatory pathways beside other targets might be the key factors to control- disease symptoms and progression. This review is aimed to highlight the mechanisms and pathways involved in the neuroprotective potentials of lead phytochemicals. Further to provide updates regarding challenges associated with their use and their progress into clinical trials as potential lead compounds. Most recent scientific literature on pre-clinical and clinical data published in quality journals especially on the lead phytochemicals including curcumin, catechins, quercetin, resveratrol, genistein and apigenin was collected using SciFinder, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, JSTOR, EBSCO, Scopus and other related web sources. Literature review indicated that the drug discovery against AD is insufficient and only few drugs are clinically approved which have limited efficacy. Among the therapeutic options, natural products have got tremendous attraction owing to their molecular diversity, their safety and efficacy. Research suggest that natural products can delay the disease onset, reduce its progression and regenerate the damage via their anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials. These agents regulate the pathways involved in the release of neurotrophins which are implicated in neuronal survival and function. Highly potential lead phytochemicals including curcumin, catechins, quercetin, resveratrol, genistein and apigenin regulate neuroprotective signaling pathways implicated in neurotrophins-mediated activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) and p75 neurotrophins receptor (p75NTR) family receptors. Phytochemicals especially phenolic compounds were identified as highly potential molecules which ameliorate oxidative stress induced neurodegeneration, reduce A\u03b2 load and inhibit vital enzymes. Yet their clinical efficacy and bioavailability are the major challenges which need further interventions for more effective therapeutic outcomes.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[The study of lipofuscin levels in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.].",
        "AbstractText": "In this study, we evaluated the change in the level of lipofuscin, an autofluorescent aging pigment, in brain and peripheral tissues in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - 5xFAD. A comparative analysis of the content of lipofuscin in homogenates of the liver, kidneys, heart, and various parts of the brain of 5xFAD mice, as well as control mice from the same litters of different ages, was carried out. The data obtained correlate well with the concept of lipofuscin as an aging pigment - its amount increases with age in both control and 5xFAD mice. We noted accumulation of lipofuscin progressive with age in 5xFAD mice, which is detected both in different parts of the brain and in peripheral organs. At the same time, the level of lipofuscin was increased even in newborn day-old mice 5xFAD. Thus, an increase in the level of lipofuscin in 5xFAD mice is one of the earliest disorders that manifests itself not only in the brain, but also in other organs. \u0412

Despite many studies seeking to identify and develop effective therapies, effective ALS treatment has yet to be approved. Hence, patients with ALS ultimately experience muscle atrophy and loss of motor neurons. Herbal medicines have been used to treat numerous diseases by modulating multiple biological processes and exerting pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, Chaenomeles sinensis Koehne (CS) exhibits anti-hyperuricemic and nephroprotective effects and is used to treat anaphylaxis, viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study monitored the effects of CS supplementation on muscle function and motor neurons in hSOD1G93A mice, an established ALS animal model. Body weight measurements and behavioral tests were performed; additionally, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted using the mice gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and spinal cord. CS augmented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the muscle and spinal cord of hSOD1G93A mice. Furthermore, CS improved motor function and regulated autophagy in the muscles of the hSOD1G93A mice. CS might represent a promising supplement for improving motor function and delaying ALS progression. However, its development for clinical use warrants further investigation.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A More Holistic Perspective of Alzheimer's Disease: Roles of Gut Microbiome, Adipocytes, HPA Axis, Melatonergic Pathway and Astrocyte Mitochondria in the Emergence of Autoimmunity.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is widely regarded as poorly treated due to poor conceptualization. For 40 years, Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology has focused on two culprits, amyloid-\u03b2 induced plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau associated tangles, with no significant treatment advance. This is confounded by data showing amyloid-\u03b2 to be an endogenous antimicrobial that is increased in a wide array of diverse medical conditions associated with heightened inflammation. This article reviews the wider bodies of data pertaining to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, highlighting the role of suppressed astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway as a core hub in driving neuronal loss in dementia. It is proposed that astrocyte function over aging becomes dysregulated, at least partly mediated by systemic processes involving the 10-fold decrease in pineal melatonin leading to the attenuated capacity of night-time melatonin to dampen residual daytime inflammation. Suppressed pineal melatonin also attenuates melatonin's inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, thereby changing not only stress/hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis consequences but also the consequences of the cortisol awakening response, which 'primes the body for the coming day'. Gut microbiome-derived butyrate also inhibits glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, as well as inducing the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. It is proposed that the loss of astrocyte melatonin prevents the autocrine and paracrine effects of melatonin in limiting amyloid-\u03b2 levels and effects. Suppressed astrocyte melatonin production also attenuates the melatonin induction of astrocyte lactate, thereby decreasing neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and the neuronal mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. The loss of astrocyte lactate and melatonin, coupled to the suppression of neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and melatonin production decreases mitophagy, leading to the induction of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1. MHC-1 initiates the chemoattraction of CD8+ t cells, leading to neuronal destruction in Alzheimer's disease being driven by 'autoimmune'/'immune-mediated' processes. Alzheimer's disease may therefore be conceptualized as being initiated by systemic processes that act on astrocytes as a core hub, with the suppression of the astrocyte melatonergic pathway leaving neurons deplete of appropriate metabolic substrates and co-ordinated antioxidants. This culminates in an 'immune-mediated' cell death. Future research and treatment/prevention implications are indicated.",

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to assess BPS. A total of 358 consecutive patients with first-ever stroke admitted to rehabilitation wards and with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores < 24 on admission were included. BPS was defined as a total NPI-Q Severity or Distress score \u2265 1. Differences between the severity and presence of BPS among patients with severe cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 0-17) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 18-23) were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-squared test, respectively. Eighty-one patients (mean (standard deviation) age, 73.5 (13.1) years) were enrolled for analysis. BPS were observed in 69.1% and 74.1% of patients when assessed with NPI-Q Severity and NPI-Q Distress, respectively. The most frequently observed BPS was apathy, followed by depression (approximately 44% and 40%, respectively). The severity and frequency of delusions, euphoria, apathy, and disinhibition were significantly higher in the severe cognitive impairment group than in the mild cognitive impairment group. However, the severity, distress, and frequency of depression were not dependent on the severity of cognitive impairment. The presence of BPS, especially apathy and depression, in subacute stroke patients with cognitive impairment is high. The severity and frequency of some BPS are higher in patients with severe cognitive impairment than in those with mild cognitive impairment. However, depression is highly prevalent among the patients regardless of the severity of cognitive impairment.",

        "AbstractText": "Contralateral hip refracture following initial hip fracture surgery is life-threatening in the elderly with high incidence and mortality. This study investigated the associated independent risk factors and established a nomogram prediction model. Totally 734 elderly patients with hip fractures who underwent surgical treatment (January 2016-December 2020) were enrolled. Following analyses on demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and laboratory examination, independent risk factors of contralateral hip fractures in the elderly were identified through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Patients were randomly allocated into training (n =\u2009513) and validation sets (n =\u2009221). A training set-based nomogram prediction model was established and assessed for predictability, discriminatory ability, and clinical applicability using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) in both sets. Contralateral hip refractures occurred in 7.08% (52/734) patients within 2\u2009years after surgery. Age, hemoglobin (Hb), heart disease, neurovascular disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were independent risk factors. The nomogram prediction model had a favorable discriminatory ability, as indicated by the areas under the ROC curves (AUC): 0.906 (95% CI, 0.845-0.967) in the training set and 0.956 (95% CI, 0.927-0.985) in the validation set. The calibration curves demonstrated a good consistency between the actual subsequent contralateral hip fracture incidence and the predicted probability. The DCA of the nomogram demonstrated the model's excellent clinical efficacy. The nomogram model enabled accurate individualized prediction for the occurrence of subsequent contralateral hip fracture in the elderly within 2\u2009years after surgical treatment, which might help clinicians with precise references for appropriate perioperative management and rehabilitation education following initial hip surgery for their patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been broadly studied on images, videos, graphs, and triangular meshes. However, it has seldom been studied on tetrahedral meshes. Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of 3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally, adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used unitary cortical thickness, graph Laplacian, and point cloud representation.",

This study investigates the modulation of neurophysiological responses in relation to the perception of protection in urban environments. By exploring the impact of immediate, previously visited, or contiguous spaces on the sensory experiences of individuals, we aim to uncover insights into the interplay between architectural design, multisensorial experiences, and the modulation of perceived protection. Using a holistic phenomenological approach, we designed an experiment involving 100 participants to examine how the atmosphere of preceding spaces influences the perception of protection in subsequent spaces. The results and conclusions of this study contribute to the development of methodologies for understanding the neurophysiological responses associated with different levels of perceived protection in urban areas. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for architects, urban designers and planners, seeking to create urban spaces that enhance well-being and foster a sense of protection.

        "AbstractText": "Copper (Cu) plays a crucial role as a trace element in various physiological processes in humans. Nonetheless, free copper ions accumulate in the brain over time, resulting in a range of pathological changes. Compelling evidence indicates that excessive free copper deposition contributes to cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Free copper levels in the serum and brain of AD patients are notably elevated, leading to reduced antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, free copper accumulation triggers a specific form of cell death, namely copper-dependent cell death (cuproptosis). This article aimed to review the correlation between copper dysregulation and the pathogenesis of AD, along with the primary pathways regulating copper homoeostasis and copper-induced death in AD. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of natural and synthetic agents, including copper chelators, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, and antioxidants, were examined. These treatments can restore copper equilibrium and prevent copper-induced cell death in AD cases. Another aim of this review was to highlight the significance of copper dysregulation and promote the development of pharmaceutical interventions to address it.",

        "AbstractText": "Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) is a potential hallmark for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as it construes the genetic expression level, giving insights into the pathological progress from the outset. Profiles of cfRNA in Caucasian AD patients have been investigated thoroughly, yet there was no report exploring cfRNAs in the ASEAN groups. This study examined the gap, expecting to support the development of point-of-care AD diagnosis. cfRNA profiles were characterized from 20 Vietnamese plasma samples (10 probable AD and 10 age-matched controls). RNA reads were subjected to differential expression (DE) analysis. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify gene modules that were significantly co-expressed. These modules' expression profiles were then correlated with AD status to identify relevant modules. Genes with the highest intramodular connectivity (module membership) were selected as hub genes. Transcript counts of differentially expressed genes were correlated with key AD measures-MMSE and MTA scores-to identify potential biomarkers. 136 genes were identified as significant AD hallmarks (p < 0.05), with 52 downregulated and 84 upregulated in the AD cohort. 45.6% of these genes are highly expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. Notably, all markers related to chronic inflammation were upregulated, and there was a significant shift in all apoptotic markers. Three co-expressed modules were found to be significantly correlated with Alzheimer's status (p < 0.05; R2> 0.5). Functional enrichment analysis on these modules reveals an association with focal adhesion, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and metal ion response leading to apoptosis, suggesting the potential participation of these pathways in AD pathology. 47 significant hub genes were found to be differentially expressed genes with the highest connectivity. Six significant hub genes (CREB1, YTHDC1, IL1RL1, PHACTR2, ANKRD36B, RNF213) were found to be significantly correlated with MTA and MMSE scores. Other significant transcripts (XRN1, UBB, CHP1, THBS1, S100A9) were found to be involved in inflammation and neuronal death. Overall, we have identified candidate transcripts in plasma cf-RNA that are differentially expressed and are implicated in inflammation and apoptosis, which can jumpstart further investigations into applying cf-RNA as an AD biomarker in Vietnam and ASEAN countries.",

To address this, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled study to investigate the therapeutic potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on patients with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)- positive AD. Participants already undergoing pharmacological treatment and testing positive for amyloid PET were divided into Active-tDCS (n\u2009=\u20098) and Sham-tDCS (n\u2009=\u20098) groups. For 12 weeks, participants or their caregivers administered daily bi-frontal tDCS (YMS-201B+, Ybrain Inc., Seongnam, Korea) at home (2 mA, 30 min). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included neuropsychological tests and blood sample measurements for oligomerized beta-amyloid. The Active-tDCS group demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive domains such as language abilities, verbal memory, and attention span and in frontal lobe functions compared to the Sham-tDCS group. Furthermore, the Active-tDCS group showed a marked reduction in post-intervention plasma A\u03b2 oligomerization tendency level, suggesting changes in pivotal AD-associated biomarkers. Our results emphasize the potential therapeutic benefits of tDCS for mild AD patients with amyloid PET positivity and stress the urgency for broader research, considering the global challenges of dementia and the need to pursue innovative therapeutic strategies.",

STAligner efficiently captures the shared tissue structures across different slices, the disease-related substructures and the dynamical changes during mouse embryonic development.

Many studies have shown that global knockout of Melatonin receptor 2 (Mtnr1b) is associated with the development of various mental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of astrocyte ablation of Mtnr1b on cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior in mice, as well as the potential biological mechanisms. A conditional Cre-loxP system allowing deletion of Mtnr1b from astrocytes was developed to investigate the specific role Mtnr1b. Control and Mtnr1b cKO\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d mice were selected for cognitive function behavioral testing (Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test) and emotion-related behavioral testing (open field, elevated plus maze). After testing, brain tissue was collected and examined by immunofluorescence for the expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1). RNA-seq was performed on hippocampal tissue from control and Mtnr1b cKO\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d mice to identify differentially expressed genes. Additional confirmation of differential gene expression was performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mtnr1b cKO\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d mice were not significantly different from control mice in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests.

        "AbstractText": "Transthyretin (TTR) is secreted by hepatocytes, retinal pigment epithelial cells, pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells, choroid plexus epithelium, and neurons under stress. The choroid plexus product is the main transporter of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) to the brain during early development. TTR is one of three relatively abundant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins (Apolipoprotein J [ApoJ] (also known as clusterin), Apolipoprotein E [ApoE], and TTR) that interact with A\u03b2 peptides in vitro, in some instances inhibiting their aggregation and toxicity. It is now clear that clusterin functions as an extracellular, and perhaps intracellular, chaperone for many misfolded proteins and that variation in its gene (Clu) is associated with susceptibility to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The function of ApoE in AD is not yet completely understood, although the ApoE4 allele has the strongest genetic association with the development of sporadic late onset AD. Despite in vitro and in vivo evidence of the interaction between TTR and A\u03b2, genomewide association studies including large numbers of sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients have failed to show significant association between variation in the TTR gene and disease prevalence. Early clinical studies suggested an inverse relationship between CSF TTR levels and AD and the possibility of using the reduced CSF TTR concentration as a biomarker. Later, more extensive analyses indicated that CSF TTR concentrations may be increased in some patients with AD. While the observed changes in TTR may be pathogenetically or biologically interesting because of the inconsistency and lack of specificity, they offered no benefit diagnostically or prognostically either independently or when added to currently employed CSF biomarkers, i.e., decreased A\u03b21-42 and increased Tau and phospho-Tau. While some clinical data suggest that increases in CSF TTR may occur early in the disease with a significant decrease late in the course, without additional, more granular data, CSF TTR changes are neither consistent nor specific enough to warrant their use as a specific AD biomarker.",

It is associated with the deposition of extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in neural plaques (NPs), as well as intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). As a new target in regulating neuroinflammation in AD, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is highly and exclusively expressed on the microglial surface. TREM2 interacts with adaptor protein DAP12 to initiate signal pathways that mainly dominant microglia phenotype and phagocytosis mobility. Furthermore, TREM2 gene mutations confer increased AD risk, and TREM2 deficiency exhibits more dendritic spine loss around neural plaques. Mechanisms for regulating TREM2 to alleviate AD has evolved as an area of AD research in recent years. Current medications targeting A\u03b2 or tau proteins are unable to reverse AD progression. Emerging evidence implicating neuroinflammation may provide novel insights, as early microglia-related inflammation can be induced decades prior to the commencement of AD-related cognitive damage. Physical exercise can exert a neuroprotective effect over the course of AD progression. This review aims to (1) summarize the pathogenesis of AD and recent updates in the field, (2) assess the concept that AD cognitive impairment is closely correlated with microglia-related inflammation, and (3) review TREM2 functions and its role between exercise and AD, which is likely to be an ideal candidate target.",

The differentially expressed UPGs were screened with bioinformatics analyses using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis was performed to explore the key gene modules associated with AD. A Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) analysis was peformed to explore the patterns of immune cells in the brain tissue of AD patients. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to examine the expression of hub genes in blood samples from healthy controls and AD patients. In this study, we identified four UPGs (USP3, HECW2, PSMB7, and UBE2V1) using multiple bioinformatic analyses. Furthermore, three UPGs (USP3, HECW2, PSMB7) that are strongly correlated with the clinical features of AD were used to construct risk score prediction markers to diagnose and predict the severity of AD. Subsequently, we analyzed the patterns of immune cells in the brain tissue of AD patients and the associations between immune cells and the three key UPGs. Finally, the risk score model was verified in several datasets of AD and showed good accuracy. Three key UPGs are identified as potential biomarker for AD patients.

Recently a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network has been found to be related to AD progression, but there is still little understanding of the ceRNA regulatory network in AD. This study aims to explore the important regulatory mechanisms of ceRNA regulatory networks containing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in AD. Data from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were used for the analysis. To study enrichment function for the upregulated and downregulated mRNAs, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape database, respectively. Based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software 3.9.1, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The hub genes in this network were identified utilizing the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. The TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB were selected to calculate the regulatory interaction between miRNAs and the hub genes. LncRNAs were predicted using RNA22. Additionally, circRNA prediction was executed using the circBank database. 711 downregulated and 670 upregulated overlapping mRNAs were identified between AD and control samples. 32 downregulated and 340 upregulated miRNAs were obtained from AD samples compared with control samples. 78 upregulated and 205 downregulated circRNAs were screened. 275 upregulated lncRNAs and 209 downregulated lncRNAs were found between AD samples and control samples. The PPI network constructed consists of 1016 nodes and 13,946 edges. Ten hub genes were selected to identify target miRNAs and ceRNAs. On the basis of the ceRNA hypothesis, a circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established. It included five lncRNAs (TRHDE-AS1, SNHG10, OIP5-AS, LINC00926 and LINC00662), 26 circRNAs, five miRNAs (hsa-miR-3158-3p, hsa-miR-4435, hsa-let-7d-3p, hsa-miR-330-5p and hsa-miR-3605-3p), and ten mRNAs (RPL11, RPL34, RPL21, RPL22, RPL6, RPL32, RPL24, RPL35, RPL31, and RPL35A).

        "AbstractText": "Containing the medical data of millions of patients, clinical data warehouses (CDWs) represent a great opportunity to develop computational tools. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are particularly sensitive to patient movements during image acquisition, which will result in artefacts (blurring, ghosting and ringing) in the reconstructed image. As a result, a significant number of MRIs in CDWs are corrupted by these artefacts and may be unusable. Since their manual detection is impossible due to the large number of scans, it is necessary to develop tools to automatically exclude (or at least identify) images with motion in order to fully exploit CDWs. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method from research to clinical data for the automatic detection of motion in 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. The method consists of two steps: a pre-training on research data using synthetic motion, followed by a fine-tuning step to generalise our pre-trained model to clinical data, relying on the labelling of 4045 images. The objectives were both (1) to be able to exclude images with severe motion, (2) to detect mild motion artefacts. Our approach achieved excellent accuracy for the first objective with a balanced accuracy nearly similar to that of the annotators (balanced accuracy>80 %). However, for the second objective, the performance was weaker and substantially lower than that of human raters. Overall, our framework will be useful to take advantage of CDWs in medical imaging and highlight the importance of a clinical validation of models trained on research data.",

Functional connectivity between areas of the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and the thalamus and caudate nucleus was higher in the absent or low small vessel disease group compared to the high small vessel disease group. These findings might suggest that functional connectivity of mild cognitive impairment individuals with low or absent small vessel disease burden is more intact than in mild cognitive impairment individuals with high small vessel disease. These brain areas are mainly responsible for motor, attentional and executive functions, domains which in previous studies were found to be mostly associated with small vessel disease markers. Our results support findings on the involvement of the cerebellum in cognitive functioning.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Genetic basis of anatomical asymmetry and aberrant dynamic functional networks in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Genetic associations with macroscopic brain networks can provide insights into healthy and aberrant cortical connectivity in disease. However, associations specific to dynamic functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease are still largely unexplored. Understanding the association between gene expression in the brain and functional networks may provide useful information about the molecular processes underlying variations in impaired brain function. Given the potential of dynamic functional connectivity to uncover brain states associated with Alzheimer's disease, it is interesting to ask: How does gene expression associated with Alzheimer's disease map onto the dynamic functional brain connectivity? If genetic variants associated with neurodegenerative processes involved in Alzheimer's disease are to be correlated with brain function, it is essential to generate such a map. Here, we investigate how the relation between gene expression in the brain and dynamic functional connectivity arises from nodal interactions, quantified by their role in network centrality (i.e. the drivers of the metastability), and the principal component of genetic co-expression across the brain. Our analyses include genetic variations associated with Alzheimer's disease and also genetic variants expressed within the cholinergic brain pathways. Our findings show that contrasts in metastability of functional networks between Alzheimer's and healthy individuals can in part be explained by the two combinations of genetic co-variations in the brain with the confidence interval between 72% and 92%. The highly central nodes, driving the brain aberrant metastable dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, highly correlate with the magnitude of variations from two combinations of genes expressed in the brain. These nodes include mainly the white matter, parietal and occipital brain regions, each of which (or their combinations) are involved in impaired cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, our results provide evidence of the role of genetic associations across brain regions in asymmetric changes in ageing. We validated our findings on the same cohort using alternative brain parcellation methods. This work demonstrates how genetic variations underpin aberrant dynamic functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease.",

The aim of this study was to assess the phenomenon of medical help-seeking in early AD and to identify associated factors. A multicenter, non-interventional study was conducted including patients of 50-90\u2009years of age with prodromal or mild AD (National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Association criteria), a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\u2009\u2265\u200922, and a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global score (CDR-GS) of 0.5-1.0. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. A total of 149 patients were included. Mean age (SD) was 72.3 (7.0) years, 50.3% were female, and 87.2% had a CDR-GS score of 0.5. Mean disease duration was 1.4 (1.8) years. Ninety-four (63.1%) patients sought medical help, mostly from neurologists. Patients with help-seeking intentions were mostly female (60.6%) with a CDR-GS score of 0.5 (91.5%) and had a greater awareness of diagnosis, poorer quality of life, more depressive symptoms, and a more severe perception of their condition than their counterparts. Lack of help-seeking intentions was associated with male sex (p\u2009=\u20090.003), fewer years of education (p\u2009=\u20090.005), a low awareness of diagnosis (p\u2009=\u20090.005), and a low emotional consequence of the condition (p\u2009=\u20090.016). Understanding the phenomenon of active medical help-seeking may facilitate the design of specific strategies to improve the detection of cognitive impairment, especially in patients with a lower level of educational attainment and poor awareness of their condition.",

Presently, various chemical and environmental agents are used to induce in-vitro models of Alzheimer disease to investigate the efficacy of different therapeutic drugs. We screened literature from databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google scholar, emphasizing the diverse targeting mechanisms of neuro degeneration explored in in-vitro models. The results revealed studies in which different types of chemicals and environmental agents were used for in-vitro development of Alzheimer-targeting mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Studies using chemically induced in-vitro AD models included in this systematic review will contribute to a deeper understanding of AD. However, none of these models can reproduce all the characteristics of disease progression seen in the majority of Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Additional modifications would be required to replicate the complex conditions of human AD in an exact manner. In-vitro models of Alzheimer's disease developed using chemicals and environmental agents are instrumental in providing insights into the disease's pathophysiology; therefore, chemical-induced in-vitro AD models will continue to play vital role in future AD research. This systematic screening revealed the pivotal role of chemical-induced in-vitro AD models in advancing our understanding of AD pathophysiology and is therefore important to understand the potential of these chemicals in AD pathogenesis.",

Mixed-methods process evaluation study. Physicians, nursing staff, client council members, and residents of Dutch NHs. We used cRCT data of the ANNA study (Antibiotic Prescribing and Non-prescribing in Nursing Home Residents With Signs and Symptoms Ascribed to Urinary Tract Infection). In addition, we sent out an online evaluation questionnaire, conducted semistructured interviews with physicians and nursing staff, and consulted client council members. Internal validity was lowered: control group physicians participated in several non-study-related activities regarding UTI. External validity was good: almost all intervention components had a high fidelity (52%-74%) and were perceived as relevant (physicians: 7.2-8.6 of 10, nursing staff: 6.5-8.5 of 10) and feasible (physicians: 7.5 of 10, nursing staff 6.4 of 10), with feasibility for residents with dementia and urine incontinence needing attention. The most common reason for deviating from the advice generated by the decision tool was an unclear illness presentation. Identified facilitators to implementation were confidence in the intervention, repeated intervention encounter, and having \"champions\" in the NH. Barriers were limited involvement of nursing staff, unstable nursing teams, residents' and representatives' belief that antibiotics should be prescribed, and a low antibiotic prescribing threshold within the NH culture. Lowered internal validity may have reduced the study effect. Attention should be paid to the feasibility of the intervention in residents with dementia and urinary incontinence.

Prospective cross-sectional study. Six Intensive Care Units (ICU's) and 17 non-ICU departments, including a psychiatric department across 10 Dutch hospitals. 494 patients, median age 75 (IQR:64-87), 53% male, 46% in ICUs, 29% delirious. DeltaScan recorded 4-minute EEGs, using an algorithm to select the first 96 seconds of artifact-free data for PDA detection. This algorithm was trained and calibrated on two independent datasets. Initial validation of the algorithm for AE involved comparing its output with an expert EEG panel's visual inspection. The primary objective was to assess DeltaScan's accuracy in identifying delirium against a delirium expert panel's consensus. DeltaScan had a 99% success rate, rejecting 6 of the 494 EEG's due to artifacts. Performance showed and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.90) for AE (sensitivity: 0.75, 95%CI=0.68-0.81, specificity: 0.87 95%CI=0.83-0.91.

Our validation aim was an NPV for delirium above 0.80 which proved to be 0.82 (95%CI: 0.77-0.86). Among 84 non-delirious psychiatric patients, DeltaScan differentiated delirium from other disorders with a 94% (95%CI: 87-98%) specificity. DeltaScan can diagnose AE at bedside and shows a clear relationship with clinical delirium. Further research is required to explore its role in predicting delirium-related outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The process of ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death (RCD) is associated with the overloading of iron species and lipid-derived ROS accumulation. Ferroptosis is induced by various mechanisms such as inhibiting system Xc, glutathione depletion, targeting excess iron, and directly inhibiting GPX4 enzyme. Also, ferroptosis inhibition is achieved by blocking excessive lipid peroxidation by targeting different pathways. These mechanisms are often related to the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Fundamentally distinct from other forms of cell death, such as necrosis and apoptosis, ferroptosis differs in terms of biochemistry, functions, and morphology. The mechanism by which ferroptosis acts as a regulatory factor in many diseases remains elusive. Studying the activation and inhibition of ferroptosis as a means to mitigate the progression of various diseases is a highly intriguing and actively researched topic. It has emerged as a focal point in etiological research and treatment strategies. This review systematically summarizes the different mechanisms involved in the inhibition and induction of ferroptosis. We have extensively explored different agents that can induce or inhibit ferroptosis. This review offers current perspectives on recent developments in ferroptosis research, highlighting the disease's etiology and presenting references to enhance its understanding.

The purpose of this review is to identify whether the gut microbiome together with the metabolome can provide critical insights to understand this heterogeneity in the response to n-3 PUFA supplementation. A Western diet with high saturated fat and omega-6 fatty acid content, obesity, and lack of exercise puts strain on the gut microbiome resulting in imbalance, dysbiosis, reduced bacterial diversity, and increased abundance of the pro-inflammatory taxa. A plant-based diet has beneficial effects on the gut microbiota even when deficient in n-3 PUFAs. Human and animal studies show that increased intake of the n-3 PUFAs correlates with increased beneficial intestinal bacteria when compared to a Western diet. The composition of the gut microbiota can help define the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on the brain and lead to more personalized nutritional interventions.",

In this work, we evaluated the differential accumulation of peptide-functionalized GNRs in a transgenic animal model (APPswe/PSENd1E9) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by computed tomography (CT) and measured the pharmacokinetic parameters and bioaccumulation of the nanosystem. The GNRs were functionalized with two peptides, Ang2 and D1, which conferred on them the properties of crossing the blood-brain barrier and binding to amyloid aggregates, respectively, thus making them a diagnostic tool with great potential for AD. The nanosystem was administered intravenously in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice of 4-, 8- and 18-months of age, and the accumulation of gold nanoparticles was observed by computed tomography (CT). The gold accumulation and biodistribution were determined by atomic absorption. Our findings indicated that 18-month-old animals treated with our nanosystem (GNR-D1/Ang2) displayed noticeable differences in CT signals compared to those treated with a control nanosystem (GNR-Ang2). However, no such distinctions were observed in younger animals. This suggests that our nanosystem holds the potential to effectively detect AD pathology. These results support the future development of gold nanoparticle-based technology as a more effective and accessible alternative for the diagnosis of AD and represent a significant advance in the development of gold nanoparticle applications in disease diagnosis.",

This study explored the effects of a circadian-effective lighting intervention on actigraphic sleep measures and subjective assessments of sleep disturbance, depression, and sleep-disturbed behaviors. Methods: Fourteen older adult (\u226560\u00a0years) participants (11 females, mean age = 84.1 [SD 8.9]), all diagnosed with moderate to severe dementia and sleep disturbance, were recruited from 3 assisted living and memory care facilities. Following a crossover, placebo-controlled design, 3 different lighting modes were used to deliver high levels of circadian stimulus to the participants' eyes for two 8-week intervention periods in a counter balanced order with a 4-week washout between the study's 2 conditions (dim light control vs. active intervention). Actigraphy and questionnaire data were collected over 7-day assessment periods that preceded (baseline weeks 1 and 9) and concluded (post-intervention week 9 and 22) the intervention periods. Actigraphic outcomes included sleep duration, sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep start time, and sleep end time. Subjective assessments included the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) instruments. Results: Under the active condition, sleep duration significantly (p = 0.018) increased and sleep start time significantly (p = 0.012) advanced after the intervention compared to baseline. Also under the active condition, PSQI (p = 0.012), CSDD (p = 0.007), Sleep Disorders Inventory frequency (p = 0.015), and SDI severity (p = 0.015) scores were significantly lower after the intervention compared to baseline.

Several approaches for functional connectivity obtain an un-directed network representing stochastic associations (correlations) between brain regions. However, association does not necessarily imply causation. In contrast, Causal Functional Connectivity (CFC) is more informative, providing a directed network representing causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, we obtained the causal functional connectome for the whole brain from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) recordings of subjects from three clinical groups: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We applied the recently developed Time-aware PC (TPC) algorithm to infer the causal functional connectome for the whole brain. TPC supports model-free estimation of whole brain CFC based on directed graphical modeling in a time series setting. We compared the CFC outcome of TPC with that of other related approaches in the literature. Then, we used the CFC outcomes of TPC and performed an exploratory analysis of the difference in strengths of CFC edges between Alzheimer's and cognitively normal groups, based on edge-wise p-values obtained by Welch's t-test.

Two-sample bidirectional MR analyses were conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Summary statistics for various neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, along with biological aging proxy indicators, were obtained from extensive meta-analyses of GWAS. Genetic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposures were used as instrumental variables, assessing causal relationships between three neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), two benign neurological tumors (vestibular schwannoma and meningioma), one malignant neurological tumor (glioma), and four biological aging indicators (frailty index, facial aging, TL, and epigenetic aging clock acceleration). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Our analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer TL reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease but increases the risk of vestibular schwannoma and glioma (All Glioma, GBM, non-GBM). In addition, there is a suggestive causal relationship between some diseases (PD and GBM) and DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration. Causal relationships between biological aging proxy indicators and other neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors were not observed. Building upon prior investigations into the causal relationships between telomeres and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, our study validates these findings using larger GWAS data and demonstrates, for the first time, that Parkinson's disease and GBM may promote epigenetic age acceleration.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most extensively researched neurodegenerative disorders due to its widespread prevalence and complex risk factors. Age is a crucial risk factor for AD, which can be estimated by the disparity between physiological age and estimated brain age. To model AD risk more effectively, integrating biological, genetic, and cognitive markers is essential. Here, we utilized mouse models expressing the major APOE human alleles and human nitric oxide synthase 2 to replicate genetic risk for AD and a humanized innate immune response. We estimated brain age employing a multivariate dataset that includes brain connectomes, APOE genotype, subject traits such as age and sex, and behavioral data. Our methodology used Feature Attention Graph Neural Networks (FAGNN) for integrating different data types. Behavioral data were processed with a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), subject traits with a 1D CNN, brain connectomes through a Graph Neural Network using quadrant attention module. The model yielded a mean absolute error for age prediction of 31.85 days, with a root mean squared error of 41.84 days, outperforming other, reduced models. In addition, FAGNN identified key brain connections involved in the aging process. The highest weights were assigned to the connections between cingulum and corpus callosum, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and piriform cortex. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting brain age in models of aging and genetic risk for AD. To verify the validity of our findings, we compared Fractional Anisotropy (FA) along the tracts of regions with the highest connectivity, the Return-to-Origin Probability (RTOP), Return-to-Plane Probability (RTPP), and Return-to-Axis Probability (RTAP), which showed significant differences between young, middle-aged, and old age groups. Younger mice exhibited higher FA, RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP compared to older groups in the selected connections, suggesting that degradation of white matter tracts plays a critical role in aging and for FAGNN's selections. Our analysis suggests a potential neuroprotective role of APOE2, relative to APOE3 and APOE4, where APOE2 appears to mitigate age-related changes.

The global accuracy of plasma pTau217 using a two-threshold approach was robust in symptomatic groups, exceeding 90%. The evaluation of blood biomarkers on an automated platform exhibited high diagnostic accuracy for AD pathophysiology, and pTau217 showed excellent diagnostic accuracy to identify participants with AD in a consecutive sample representing the routine clinical practice in a specialized memory unit.",

        "AbstractText": "While there are currently over 40 replicated genes with mapped risk alleles for Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the Apolipoprotein E locus E4 haplotype is still the biggest driver of risk, with odds ratios for neuropathologically confirmed E44 carriers exceeding 30 (95% confidence interval 16.59-58.75). We sought to address whether the APOE E4 haplotype modifies expression globally through networks of expression to increase LOAD risk. We have used the Human Brainome data to build expression networks comparing APOE E4 carriers to non-carriers using scalable mixed-datatypes Bayesian network (BN) modeling. We have found that VGF had the greatest explanatory weight. High expression of VGF is a protective signal, even on the background of APOE E4 alleles. LOAD risk signals, considering an APOE background, include high levels of SPECC1L, HLA-DRA and RANBP3L. Our findings nominate several new transcripts, taking a combined approach to network building including known LOAD risk loci.",

        "AbstractText": "DNA breaks accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. While their role as true genomic lesions is recognized, DNA breaks also support cognitive function by facilitating the expression of activity-dependent immediate early genes (IEGs). This process involves TOP2B, a DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). To characterize how AD impacts adaptive DNA breaks at nervous system genes. We leveraged the ability of DNA single- and double-strand breaks to activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that conjugate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to adjacent proteins. To characterize the genomic sites harboring DNA breaks in AD brains, nuclei extracted from 3 AD and 3 non-demented (ND) autopsy brains (frontal cortex, all male donors, age 78 to 91 years of age) were analyzed through CUT&RUN in which we targeted PAR with subsequent DNA sequencing. Although the AD brains contained 19.9 times more PAR peaks than the ND brains, PAR peaks at nervous system genes were profoundly lost in AD brains, and the expression of these genes was downregulated. This result is consistent with our previous CUT&RUN targeting \u03b3H2AX, which marks DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In addition, TOP2B expression was significantly decreased in the AD brains. Although AD brains contain a net increase in DNA breaks, adaptive DNA breaks at nervous system genes are lost in AD brains. This could potentially reflect diminished TOP2B expression and contribute to impaired neuron function and cognition in AD patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder requiring accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and gray matter volume analysis from structural MRI have emerged as valuable tools for investigating AD-related brain alterations. However, the potential benefits of integrating these modalities using deep learning techniques remain unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel framework that fuses composite images of multiple rs-fMRI networks (called voxelwise intensity projection) and gray matter segmentation images through a deep learning approach for improved AD classification. We demonstrate the superiority of fMRI networks over commonly used metrics such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF in capturing spatial maps critical for AD classification. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural network incorporating the AlexNet dropout architecture to effectively model spatial and temporal dependencies in the integrated data. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset of AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing improved classification performance of 94.12% test accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) score of 97.79 compared to existing methods. Our results show that the fusion results generally outperformed the unimodal results. The saliency visualizations also show significant differences in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate nucleus, and regions of basal ganglia which are in line with the previous neurobiological literature. Our research offers a novel method to enhance our grasp of AD pathology. By integrating data from various functional networks with structural MRI insights, we significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. This accuracy is further boosted by the effective visualization of this combined information. This lays the groundwork for further studies focused on providing a more accurate and personalized approach to AD diagnosis. The proposed framework and insights gained from fMRI networks provide a promising avenue for future research in deep multimodal fusion and neuroimaging analysis.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite the importance of the endothelium in the regulation of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in aging and neurodegenerative disease, difficulties in extracting endothelial cell (EC) nuclei have limited analysis of these cells. In addition, nearly all Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD), and a large portion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) exhibit neuronal TDP-43 aggregation, leading to loss of nuclear function, but whether TDP-43 is similarly altered in human BBB ECs is unknown. Here we utilize a novel technique for the enrichment of endothelial and microglial nuclei from human cortical brain tissues, combined with inCITE-seq, to analyze nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts in a large cohort of healthy and diseased donors. Our findings reveal a unique transcriptional signature in nearly half of the capillary endothelial cells across neurodegenerative states, characterized by reduced levels of nuclear \u03b2-Catenin and canonical downstream genes, and an increase in TNF/NF-kB target genes. We demonstrate that this does not correlate with increased nuclear p65/NF-kB, but rather a specific loss of nuclear TDP-43 in these disease associated ECs. Comparative analysis in animal models with targeted disruption of TDP-43 shows that this is sufficient to drive these transcriptional alterations. This work reveals that TDP-43 is a critical governor of the transcriptional output from nuclear p65/NF-kB, which has paradoxical roles in barrier maintenance and also barrier compromising inflammatory responses, and suggests that disease specific loss in ECs contributes to BBB defects observed in the progression of AD, ALS and FTD.",

This study examined whether distinct cortical proteins provide resilience for different cognitive abilities. Participants were from the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project who had undergone annual assessments of 5 cognitive abilities and postmortem assessment of 9 Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) pathologies. Proteome-wide examination of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using tandem mass tag and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry yielded 8,425 high-abundance proteins. We applied linear mixed-effect models to quantify residual cognitive change (cognitive resilience) of 5 cognitive abilities by regressing out cognitive decline related to age, sex, education, and indices of ADRD pathologies. Then we added terms for each of the individual proteins to identify cognitive resilience proteins associated with the different cognitive abilities. We included 604 decedents (69% female; mean age at death = 89 years) with proteomic data. A total of 47 cortical proteins that provide cognitive resilience were identified: 22 were associated with specific cognitive abilities, and 25 were common to at least 2 cognitive abilities. NRN1 was the only protein that was associated with more than 2 cognitive abilities (semantic memory: estimate = 0.020, SE = 0.004, p = 2.2 \u00d7 10-6; episodic memory: estimate = 0.029, SE = 0.004, p = 5.8 \u00d7 10-1; and working memory: estimate = 0.021, SE = 0.004, p = 1.2 \u00d7 10-7). Exploratory gene ontology analysis suggested that among top molecular pathways, mitochondrial translation was a molecular mechanism providing resilience in episodic memory, while nuclear-transcribed messenger RNA catabolic processes provided resilience in working memory. This study identified cortical proteins associated with various cognitive abilities. Differential associations across abilities may reflect distinct underlying biological pathways.

We evaluated how self-reported sleep duration and its change over time associate with (A)myloid, (T)au, (N)eurodegeneration, and (V)ascular neuroimaging markers of Alzheimer disease. Two Framingham Heart Study overlapping samples were studied: participants who underwent 11C-Pittsburg Compound B amyloid and 18F-flortaucipir tau PET imaging and participants who underwent an MRI. MRI metrics estimated neurodegeneration (total brain volume) and cerebrovascular injuries (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] volume, covert brain infarcts, free-water [FW] fraction). Self-reported sleep duration was assessed and split into categories both at the time of neuroimaging testing and approximately 13 years before: short \u22646 hours. average 7-8 hours, and long \u22659 hours. Logistic and linear regression models were used to examine sleep duration and neuroimaging metrics.

No fully adjusted association was observed between cross-sectional sleep duration and neuroimaging metrics. In fully adjusted models compared with consistently sleeping 7-8 hours, groups transitioning to a longer sleep duration category over time had higher FW fraction (short to average \u03b2 [SE] 0.0062 [0.0024], p = 0.009; short to long \u03b2 [SE] 0.0164 [0.0076], p = 0.031; average to long \u03b2 [SE] 0.0083 [0.0022], p = 0.002), and those specifically going from average to long sleep duration also had higher WMH burden (\u03b2 [SE] 0.29 [0.11], p = 0.007).

These criteria have been validated in symptomatic samples, with improved diagnostic yield. We set out to investigate the accuracy of the Boston criteria v2.0 for the diagnosis of CAA in a community-based sample. Participants were recruited from longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging conducted at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago: the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Deceased participants with in vivo 3T MRI and detailed pathologic data available were included in the analysis. We compared the diagnostic yield of the current and earlier versions of the Boston criteria in our sample. Among those classified as probable CAA according to the Boston criteria v2.0, we investigated the ability of each neuroimaging marker to distinguish between false-positive and true-positive cases. In total, 134 individuals were included in the study (mean age = 82.4 \u00b1 6.0 years; 69.4% F), and 49 of them were considered pathology-proven definite cases with CAA (mean age = 82.9 \u00b1 6.0 years; 63.3% F). The Boston criteria versions 1.0 and 1.5 yielded similar sensitivity (26.5%, both), specificity (90.6% and 89.4%, respectively), and predictive values (negative: 68.1% and 67.9%; positive: 61.9% and 59.1%, respectively). The recently released Boston criteria v2.0 offered higher sensitivity (38.8%) and slightly lower specificity (83.5%). Among those classified as probable CAA (v2.0), pathology-proven true-positive cases had higher numbers of strictly cortical lobar microbleeds compared with false-positive cases (p = 0.004). Similar to findings from symptomatic samples, the inclusion of nonhemorrhagic neuroimaging markers in the updated Boston criteria offered a 12.3% gain in sensitivity among community-dwelling individuals, at the expense of a 5.9% drop in specificity. In cases with probable CAA, the cortical location of microbleeds may represent a promising distinguishing feature between true-positive and false-positive cases. Despite its improved performance, the diagnostic sensitivity of the updated criteria in a community-based sample remains limited.

Based on common inclusion criteria for clinical trials, we defined groups (amyloid, phosphorylated tau [p-tau], APOE \u03b54). Linear mixed models, adjusted for age, sex, and education, were used to estimate change over time in neuropsychological tests, a functional outcome, and 2 cognitive composite measures. Standardized regression coefficients of time in years (\u03b2time) were reported as outcome of interest. We analyzed change over time with full follow-up, as well as with follow-up limited to 1.5 and 3 years. We included 387 individuals (aged 61.7 \u00b1 8.6 years; 44% female) in the following (partly overlapping) biomarker groups: APOE \u03b54 carriers (n = 212), amyloid-positive individuals (n = 109), amyloid-positive APOE \u03b54 carriers (n = 66), CSF p-tau-positive individuals (n = 127), plasma p-tau-positive individuals (n = 71), and amyloid and CSF p-tau-positive individuals (n = 50), or in a control group (normal biomarkers; n = 65). An executive functioning task showed most decline in all biomarker groups (\u03b2time range -0.30 to -0.71), followed by delayed word list recognition (\u03b2time range -0.18 to -0.50). Functional decline (\u03b2time range -0.17 to -0.63) was observed in all, except the CSF and plasma tau-positive groups. Both composites showed comparable amounts of change (\u03b2time range -0.12 to -0.62) in all groups, except plasma p-tau-positive individuals. When limiting original follow-up duration, many effects disappeared or even flipped direction. In conclusion, functional, composite, and neuropsychological outcome measures across all cognitive domains detect changes over time in various biomarker-defined groups, with changes being most evident among individuals with more AD pathology. AD prevention trials should use sufficiently long follow-up duration and/or more sensitive outcome measures to optimally capture subtle cognitive changes over time.",

We evaluated biological correlates of WMH in former American football players, including markers of amyloid, tau, inflammation, axonal injury, neurodegeneration, and vascular health. Participants underwent clinical interviews, MRI, and lumbar puncture as part of the Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research Project. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect effects between log-transformed total fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion volumes (TLV) and the revised Framingham stroke risk profile (rFSRP), MRI-derived global metrics of cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA), and CSF levels of amyloid \u03b21-42, p-tau181, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and neurofilament light. Covariates included age, race, education, body mass index, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, and evaluation site. Models were performed separately for former football players and a control group of asymptomatic men unexposed to RHI. In 180 former football players (mean age = 57.2, 36% Black), higher log(TLV) had direct associations with the following: higher rFSRP score (B = 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.40), higher p-tau181 (B = 0.17, 95% CI 0.01-0.43), lower FA (B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.13), and reduced cortical thickness (B = -0.25, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08). In 60 asymptomatic unexposed men (mean age = 59.3, 40% Black), there were no direct effects on log(TLV) (rFSRP: B = -0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.57; p-tau181: B = -0.30, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.37; FA: B = -0.07, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.42; or cortical thickness: B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.10). The former football players showed stronger associations between log(TLV) and rFSRP (1,069% difference in estimates), p-tau181 (158%), and FA (287%) than the unexposed men. Risk factors and biological correlates of WMH differed between former American football players and asymptomatic unexposed men. In addition to vascular health, p-tau181 and diffusion tensor imaging indices of white matter integrity showed stronger associations with WMH in the former football players. FLAIR WMH may have specific risk factors and pathologic underpinnings in RHI-exposed individuals.",

        "AbstractText": "Clinical trials developing therapeutics for frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) focus on pathogenic variant carriers at preclinical stages. Objective, quantitative clinical assessment tools are needed to track stability and delayed disease onset. Natural speech can serve as an accessible, cost-effective assessment tool. We aimed to identify early changes in the natural speech of FTD pathogenic variant carriers before they become symptomatic. In this cohort study, speech samples of picture descriptions were collected longitudinally from healthy participants in observational studies at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University between 2007 and 2020. Participants were asymptomatic but at risk for familial FTD. Status as \"carrier\" or \"noncarrier\" was based on screening for known pathogenic variants in the participant's family. Thirty previously validated digital speech measures derived from automatic speech processing pipelines were selected a priori based on previous studies in patients with FTD and compared between asymptomatic carriers and noncarriers cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A total of 105 participants, all asymptomatic, included 41 carriers: 12 men [30%], mean age 43 \u00b1 13 years; education, 16 \u00b1 2 years; MMSE 29 \u00b1 1; and 64 noncarriers: 27 men [42%]; mean age, 48 \u00b1 14 years; education, 15 \u00b1 3 years; MMSE 29 \u00b1 1. We identified 4 speech measures that differed between carriers and noncarriers at baseline: mean speech segment duration (mean difference -0.28 seconds, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.02, p = 0.04); word frequency (mean difference 0.07, 95% CI 0.008-0.14, p = 0.03); word ambiguity (mean difference 0.02, 95% CI 0.0008-0.05, p = 0.04); and interjection count per 100 words (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.07-0.59, p = 0.01). Three speech measures deteriorated over time in carriers only: particle count per 100 words per month (\u03b2 = -0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to -0.004, p = 0.009); total narrative production time in seconds per month (\u03b2 = -0.24, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.12, p < 0.001); and total number of words per month (\u03b2 = -0.48, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.19, p = 0.002) including in 3 carriers who later converted to symptomatic disease. Using automatic processing pipelines, we identified early changes in the natural speech of FTD pathogenic variant carriers in the presymptomatic stage. These findings highlight the potential utility of natural speech as a digital clinical outcome assessment tool in FTD, where objective and quantifiable measures for abnormal behavior and language are lacking.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulating evidence suggests that gray matter atrophy, often considered a marker of Alzheimer disease (AD), can also result from cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a form of sporadic CSVD, diagnosed through neuroimaging criteria, that often co-occurs with AD pathology and leads to cognitive impairment. We sought to identify the role of hippocampal integrity in the development of cognitive impairment in a cohort of patients with possible and probable CAA. Patients were recruited from an ongoing CAA study at Massachusetts General Hospital. Composite scores defined performance in the cognitive domains of memory, language, executive function, and processing speed. Hippocampal subfields' volumes were measured from 3T MRI, using an automated method, and multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate their association with each cognitive domain and relationship to CAA-related neuroimaging markers. One hundred twenty patients, 36 with possible (age mean [range]: 75.6 [65.6-88.9]), 67 with probable CAA (75.9 [59.0-94.0]), and 17 controls without cognitive impairment and CSVD (72.4 [62.5-82.7]; 76.4% female patients), were included in this study. We found a positive association between all investigated hippocampal subfields and memory and language, whereas specific subfields accounted for executive function (CA4 [Estimate = 5.43; 95% CI 1.26-9.61; p = 0.020], subiculum [Estimate = 2.85; 95% CI 0.67-5.02; p = 0.022]), and processing speed (subiculum [Estimate = 1.99; 95% CI 0.13-3.85; p = 0.036]). These findings were independent of other CAA-related markers, which did not have an influence on cognition in this cohort. Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), a measure of white matter integrity, was negatively associated with hippocampal subfields' volumes (CA3 [Estimate = -0.012; 95% CI -0.020 to -0.004; p = 0.034], CA4 [Estimate = -0.010; 95% CI -0.020 to -0.0007; p = 0.037], subiculum [Estimate = -0.019; 95% CI -0.042 to -0.0001; p = 0.003]). These results suggest that hippocampal integrity is an independent contributor to cognitive impairment in patients with CAA and that it might be related to loss of integrity in the white matter. Further studies exploring potential causes and directionality of the relationship between white matter and hippocampal integrity may be warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "There is currently no validated disease-stage biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The identification of quantitative and reproducible markers of disease stratification in ALS is fundamental for study design definition and inclusion of homogenous patient cohorts into clinical trials. Our aim was to assess the rearrangements of structural and functional brain connectivity underlying the clinical stages of ALS, to suggest objective, reproducible measures provided by MRI connectomics mirroring disease staging. In this observational study, patients with ALS and healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical evaluation and brain MRI on a 3T scanner. Patients were classified into 4 groups, according to the King's staging system. Structural and functional brain connectivity matrices were obtained using diffusion tensor and resting-state fMRI data, respectively. Whole-brain network-based statistics (NBS) analysis and comparisons of intraregional and inter-regional connectivity values using analysis of covariance models were performed between groups. Correlations between MRI and clinical/cognitive measures were tested using Pearson coefficient. One hundred four patients with ALS and 61 age-matched and sex-matched HCs were included. NBS and regional connectivity analyses demonstrated a progressive decrease of intranetwork and internetwork structural connectivity of sensorimotor regions at increasing ALS stages in our cohort, compared with HCs. By contrast, functional connectivity showed divergent patterns between King's stages 3 (increase in basal ganglia and temporal circuits [p = 0.04 and p = 0.05, respectively]) and 4 (frontotemporal decrease [p = 0.03]), suggesting a complex interplay between opposite phenomena in late stages of the disease. Intraregional sensorimotor structural connectivity was correlated with ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-r) score (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and upper motor neuron burden (r = -0.25, p = 0.01). Inter-regional frontal-sensorimotor structural connectivity was also correlated with ALSFRS-r (r = 0.24, p = 0.02). No correlations with cognitive measures were found. MRI of the brain allows to demonstrate and quantify increasing disruption of structural connectivity involving the sensorimotor networks in ALS, mirroring disease stages. Frontotemporal functional disconnection seems to characterize only advanced disease phases. Our findings support the utility of MRI connectomics to stratify patients and stage brain pathology in ALS in a reproducible way, which may mirror clinical progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Very divergent prevalence rates for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) are reported, probably due to differences in study sample selection and diagnostic criteria. This MRI-based study aimed to determine the prevalence of iNPH and iNPH-specific radiologic changes and their association with clinical symptoms in a large, 70-year-old population-based cohort (Gothenburg H70). In this cross-sectional study, disturbances in gait and balance, cognition, and urinary continence were assessed using clinical examination and self-report. MRI was evaluated for iNPH-specific imaging markers. iNPH was diagnosed according to International Guidelines (I.G.). Based on radiologic findings, participants were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: (A) Evans index (EI) \u22640.3 (reference), (B) EI >0.3 without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings, (C) radiologically probable iNPH according to I.G., and (D) radiologically holistically probable (h-probable) iNPH fulfilling radiologic criteria according to I.G. plus highly iNPH-specific changes according to an experienced neuroradiologist. The Gothenburg H70 Studies include 791 individuals (377 men, 414 women) born in 1944 who underwent brain MRI. The prevalence of iNPH was 1.5% (2.1% for men, 0.96% for women) according to I.G. Ninety participants (11%) had EI >0.3 without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings, 29 (3.7%) fulfilled the I.G. radiologic probable iNPH criteria alone, and 11 (1.4%) were classified as radiologically h-probable iNPH. Forty participants (5.1%) had I.G. radiologic features of iNPH (70% men vs 30% women, p = 0.005). Gait disturbances were more common in participants with EI >0.3 without other radiologic iNPH features (B) (33%) compared with the reference group (A) (19%) (p = 0.006). All clinical symptoms were more common in participants with I.G. radiologic features of iNPH (C + D) than they were in the reference group (A) (p < 0.03). The iNPH prevalence of 1.5% among 70-year-olds, which is considerably higher than earlier reported in this age group, suggests that iNPH may be more common than previously assumed. This is supported by the 5.1% total prevalence of imaging signs of iNPH. Ventriculomegaly without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings may be an early sign of developing iNPH in some patients.",

        "AbstractText": "In the last 2 years, there have been 3 successful trials of antiamyloid antibodies in Alzheimer disease (AD): aducanemab, now controversially US Food and Drug Administration-approved under the accelerated approval pathway1; lecanemab, now FDA-approved2; and donanemab, now going through the approval process.3 All 3 share a common broad mechanism, that is, antibody-mediated removal of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) from the brain, and this is almost certainly the basis of their therapeutic action.4 When used in the earliest symptomatic stages of AD, all have modest clinical effects, all clear A\u03b2 from the brain, and all show evidence for some changes in molecular markers believed to be downstream of A\u03b2 accumulation in keeping with disease modification.4 However, all these drugs-and several other antiamyloid immunotherapies that failed to show positive effects in clinical trials (e.g. bapineuzemab and gantenerumab)5,6-have the troubling adverse event of antibody-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). ARIA can take the form of vasogenic edema or sulcal effusion (ARIA-E) or haemosiderin deposition due to hemorrhage (ARIA-H).7 In vivo, ARIA is detected using MRI: ARIA-E is visible on fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequences; ARIA-H is best seen on iron-sensitive (T2* or susceptibility-weighted imaging) as microbleeds and/or superficial hemosiderin deposition. The pathophysiology of ARIA has yet to be fully determined but may result from antibody-mediated breakdown of amyloid plaques releasing A\u03b2 which is deposited in vessels leading to increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy or alterations in perivascular clearance or inflammation, possibly through complement activation.8.",

Resting-state (RS) EEG is promising for the investigation of brain electrical substrates in neurodegenerative conditions. In this study, we aim to explore EEG cortical sources in the characterization of the 3 variants of PPA. This is a cross-sectional, single-center, memory center-based cohort study. Patients with PPA and healthy controls were consecutively recruited at the Neurology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy). Each participant underwent an RS 19-channel EEG. Using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, EEG current source densities were estimated at voxel level and compared among study groups. Using an RS functional MRI-driven model of source reconstruction, linear lagged connectivity (LLC) values within language and extra-language brain networks were obtained and analyzed among groups. Eighteen patients with logopenic PPA variant (lvPPA; mean age = 72.7 \u00b1 6.6; % female = 52.4), 21 patients with nonfluent/agrammatic PPA variant (nfvPPA; mean age = 71.7 \u00b1 8.1; % female = 66.6), and 9 patients with semantic PPA variant (svPPA; mean age = 65.0 \u00b1 6.9; % female = 44.4) were enrolled in the study, together with 21 matched healthy controls (mean age = 69.2 \u00b1 6.5; % female = 57.1). Patients with lvPPA showed a higher delta density than healthy controls (p < 0.01) and patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05) and svPPA (p < 0.05). Patients with lvPPA also displayed a greater theta density over the left posterior hemisphere (p < 0.01) and lower alpha2 values (p < 0.05) over the left frontotemporal regions than controls. Patients with nfvPPA showed a diffuse greater theta density than controls (p < 0.05). LLC was altered in all patients relative to controls (p < 0.05); the alteration was greater at slow frequency bands and within language networks than extra-language networks. Patients with lvPPA also showed greater LLC values at theta band than patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05). EEG findings in patients with PPA suggest that lvPPA-related pathology is associated with a characteristic disruption of the cortical electrical activity, which might help in the differential diagnosis from svPPA and nfvPPA. EEG connectivity was disrupted in all PPA variants, with distinct findings in disease-specific PPA groups. This study provides Class IV evidence that EEG analysis can distinguish PPA due to probable Alzheimer disease from PPA due to probable FTD from normal aging.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were the most common adverse events reported in the phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE trials of aducanumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody. APOE \u03b54 carrier status has been shown to increase risk of ARIA in prior trials of aducanumab and other anti-amyloid therapies; however, the remainder of the human genome has not been evaluated for ARIA risk factors. Therefore, we sought to determine in a hypothesis-free manner whether genetic variants beyond APOE influence risk of ARIA in aducanumab-treated patients. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ARIA in participants in the ENGAGE and EMERGE trials. Participants had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease or mild Alzheimer disease dementia and were amyloid-positive on PET scans. All participants underwent regular MRI monitoring to detect and diagnose ARIA. Of the 3,285 participants in the intent-to-treat population, this analysis included 1,691 with genotyping array data who received at least one dose of aducanumab with at least one post-baseline MRI. All participants in the study cohort were of European ancestry; 51% were female. The mean age was 70.3 years. 31% had ARIA-E, 19% had ARIA-H microhemorrhage, and 14% had ARIA-H superficial siderosis. We identified one genome-wide significant (p < 5.0 \u00d7 10-8) association at the chromosome 19 locus encompassing APOE. The APOE association with ARIA was stronger in \u03b54/\u03b54 homozygotes (OR = 4.28, 4.58, 7.84; p < 2.9 \u00d7 10-14 for ARIA-E, ARIA-H microhemorrhage, and ARIA-H superficial siderosis, respectively) than in \u03b53/\u03b54 heterozygotes (OR = 1.74, 1.46, 3.14; p \u2264 0.03). We found greater odds of radiographically severe ARIA (OR = 7.04-24.64, p \u2264 2.72 \u00d7 10-5) than radiographically mild ARIA (OR = 3.19-5.00, p \u2264 1.37 \u00d7 10-5) among \u03b54/\u03b54 homozygotes. APOE \u03b54 was also significantly associated with both symptomatic (\u03b54/\u03b54 OR = 3.64-9.52; p < 0.004) and asymptomatic (\u03b54/\u03b54 OR = 4.20-7.94, p < 1.7 \u00d7 10-11) cases, although among ARIA cases, APOE did not appear to modulate symptomatic status. No other genome-wide significant associations were found. We identified a strong, genome-wide significant association between APOE and risk of ARIA. Future, larger studies may be better powered to detect associations beyond APOE. These findings indicate that APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor of ARIA incidence, with implications for patient management and risk-benefit treatment decisions. Both trials (ENGAGE [221AD301]: NCT02477800 and EMERGE [221AD302]: NCT02484547) were registered in June 2015 at clinicaltrials.gov and enrolled patients from August 2015 to July 2018.",

Our second objective was to compare NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum (S) with the routine neurodegeneration biomarkers used in AD, and to assess their concentrations relative to the degree of cognitive deficit. Samples from 124 healthy volunteers were used to estimate the S NfL RI. For the comparison study, we used CSF and S samples from 112 patients with cognitive disorders. Cognitive functions were assessed using the mini-mental state examination. ELISA assays were used to determine the CSF and S NfL levels, CSF \u03b2-amyloid peptide42 (A\u03b242), CSF \u03b2-amyloid peptide40 (A\u03b240), CSF total tau protein (tTau), CSF phosphorylated tau protein (pTau), and CSF alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S). The estimated RI of S NfL were 2.25-9.19 ng.L-1. The cut-off value of S NfL for assessing the degree of neuronal impairment was 10.5 ng.L-1. We found a moderate statistically significant correlation between S NfL and CSF A\u03b242 in the group with movement disorders, without dementia (rs = 0.631; p = 0.016); between S NfL and CSF A\u03b240 in the group with movement disorder plus dementia (rs = -0.750; p = 0.052); between S NfL and CSF tTau in the control group (rs = 0.689; p = 0.009); and between S NfL and CSF pTau in the control group (rs = 0.749; p = 0.003).

Additionally, ten C57BL/6 mice were included as a control group (Control). In the EA group, mice underwent flat needling at Baihui and Yintang, as well as point needling at Renzhong, once daily for 15\u00a0min each time. In the DFX group, mice received intraperitoneal injections of deferasirox at a dosage of 100\u00a0mg/kg/day. Following the 28-day treatment period, behavioral evaluation, morphological observation of neurons, and detection of neuronal ferroptosis were conducted. The electroacupuncture treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in spatial learning, memory ability, and neuronal damage in mice with AD. Analysis of neuronal ferroptosis markers indicated that electroacupuncture interventions reduced the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, iron, and ptgs2 expression, while also increasing superoxide dismutase activity, Ferroportin 1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 expression. Moreover, the regulatory impact of electroacupuncture on ferroptosis may be attributed to its ability to enhance the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. This study suggested that electroacupuncture could inhibit the neuronal ferroptosis by activating the antioxidant function in neurons through p62/Keap1/Nrf2 signal pathway, thereby improve the cognitive function of AD mice by the neuronal protection effect.",

Furthermore, a reference pangenome allows for the identification of previously undetected structural commonalities and differences among individuals, which may help in the diagnosis of a disease, support the prediction of what will happen over time (prognosis) and aid in developing novel treatments in the perspective of personalized medicine. Therefore, in the present review, the application of the pangenome concept to the study of neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed and analyzed for its potential to enable an improvement in diagnosis and prognosis for these illnesses, leading to the development of tailored treatments for individual patients from the knowledge of the genomic composition of a whole population.",

        "AbstractText": "We conducted an umbrella review of virtual reality (VR) technology interventions and cognitive improvement in older adults with cognitive disorders to establish a hierarchy of evidence. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases from database creation to February 2023. We included meta-analyses relevant to our study objectives for the overall review. We assessed the methodological quality according to AMSTAR2, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method to assess the credibility of the evidence. This overall review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023423063). We identified six meta-analyses that included 12 cognitive outcomes, but only memory (Standardized Mean Difference(SMD) =\u00a00.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.49), depression (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.72), and global cognition (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.66) improved through the VR technology intervention. Using the 95% prediction interval (PI) results, we found that VR technology did not significantly affect the cognitive abilities of people with cognitive decline despite increasing the subject size. We conclude that the VR technology intervention improved only specific cognitive abilities.",

        "AbstractText": "The overexpression of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), commonly observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), can induce the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. Hence, designing a selective DYRK1A inhibitor would result in a promising small molecule for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Developing selective inhibitors for DYRK1A has been a difficult challenge due to the highly preserved ATP-binding site of protein kinases. In this study, we employed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) campaign targeting DYRK1A from a database containing 1.6 million compounds. Enzymatic assays were utilized to verify inhibitory properties, confirming that Y020-3945 and Y020-3957 showed inhibitory activity towards DYRK1A. In particular, the compounds exhibited high selectivity for DYRK1A over a panel of 120 kinases, reduced the phosphorylation of tau, and reversed the tubulin polymerization for microtubule stability. Additionally, treatment with the compounds significantly reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 activated by DYRK1A-assisted NFTs and A\u03b2 oligomers. These identified inhibitors possess promising therapeutic potential for conditions associated with DYRK1A in neurodegenerative diseases. The results showed that Y020-3945 and Y020-3957 demonstrated structural novelty compared to known DYRK1A inhibitors, making them a valuable addition to developing potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Graphene and graphene oxide based 2D nanomaterials remained the most sought after for several years but the quest to design superior 2D nanomaterials which can find wider application gave rise to development of non-graphene 2D materials as well. Consequently, in addition to graphene based 2D nanomaterials, 2D nanostructures designed using macromolecules (such as DNAs, proteins, peptides and peptoids), transition metal dichalcogenides, transition-metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXene), black phosphorous, chitosan, hexagonal boron nitrides, and graphitic carbon nitride, and covalent organic frameworks have been developed. Interestingly, these 2D nanomaterials have found applications in diagnosis and treatment of various diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although AD is one of the most debilitating neurodegenerative conditions across the globe; unfortunately, there remains a paucity of effective diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention for it till date. In this scenario, nanomaterial-based biosensors, or therapeutics especially 2D nanostructures are emerging to be promising in this regard. This review summarizes the diagnostic and therapeutic platforms developed for AD using 2D nanostructures. Collectively, it is worth mentioning that these 2D nanomaterials would seemingly provide an alternative and intriguing platform for biomedical interventions.",

In the future, there may be effective disease-modifying therapies, and use of clinical rating scales as well as possible biomarkers in serum or cerebrospinal fluid may be of importance. We evaluated the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma (p-NfL) as a possible biomarker for disease severity in FRDA. We searched for all possible genetically confirmed FRDA cases in the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Region (VGR) of Sweden, and investigated each patient clinically and obtained blood sample for analysis of p-NfL. We found eight patients corresponding to 1/170.000 adults in the VGR, and 5 of these participated in the study. Three out of the five FRDA patients displayed a small or moderate increase in the p-NfL value, compared to the age-adjusted cut-offs for p-NfL established in the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at our hospital. The two others were the oldest and most severely affected, displayed normal values according the cut-off values. The cohort is too small to make any statistically significant correlation between the five p-NfL values with regard to disease severity. FRDA is less prevalent in our region of Sweden than could be assumed. In concordance with previous studies from other authors, we find that p-NfL may be increased in patients with FRDA, but less so in older more clinically affected patients. Thus, we conclude that on an individual basis, p-NFL is of uncertain clinical value as a suitable biomarker.",

Free radicals are created during oxidative stress in cells, which are considered one of the destructive factors in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the antifibrillar and antioxidant properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. The CeO2 NPs were synthesized and analyzed to reveal the physicochemical and biological properties. The results showed that the CeO2 NPs have unique properties with potent antioxidant activities. The experimental and computational studies showed that the CeO2 NPs interact with the active site of Alpha-synuclein. The existence of hydrogen bonding between O atoms of CeO2 NPs and N-H of adjacent acid amines and the equilibrium distances were confirmed by 1.751 (Leu100), 1.786 (Gln99) and 2.213\u00a0\u00c5 (Lys97). The minimum free energy binding of L-DOPA drug (as positive control) and CeO2 NPs were negative, resulting interaction between compounds and protein. As a result, these compounds inhibited Alpha-synuclein protein aggregation. In addition, that CeO2 NPs strongly binds with receptor by relative binding energy as compared with L-DOPA drug. These findings revealed that CeO2 NPs prevent Alpha-synuclein fibrillation and can be applied as nano-drug against the Parkinson's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a systemic inflammatory disease of the elderly population that increases in incidence as age advances. It is characterised by the sudden or sub-acute onset of symptoms affecting the shoulder and pelvic girdles, often accompanied by constitutional symptoms. Due to the lack of consensual diagnostic criteria and specific laboratory or radiological investigations for PMR, its diagnosis can be very challenging, particularly because it can be mimicked or masked by other geriatric syndromes. PMR responds well to glucocorticoid treatment, but if left untreated, can lead to morbidity and poor quality of life. We present the case of an 87-year-old male who presented with a one-week history of localised pain in the left hip joint, later involving the contralateral hip. Previously able to ambulate unaided, his mobility was now severely impaired. Due to his Alzheimer's dementia and multiple comorbid geriatric conditions, extensive investigations were undertaken before a diagnosis of atypical PMR was reached. Treatment with a low dose of prednisolone led to a full recovery. This case highlights the inconsistency between an atypical presentation and the classic presentation of PMR and draws attention to the possibility of missed diagnosis in older, frail patients. Atypical symptomatology on top of cognitive impairment and language barriers can be easily overlooked and left untreated and could lead to severe adverse outcomes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as PMR is readily diagnosed, but the treatment with glucocorticoids, though generally straightforward, can pose challenges, particularly when dealing with polypharmacy and multiple coexisting health conditions.",

This study assessed the concurrent validity between dual-task walking speed assessments and the Total II score of CERAD-NP using Spearman's rank order correlations. The effect of the dual-task walking speed assessments on the Total II score was further investigated through multiple linear regression analysis. There was a moderate and statically significant association between the Total II score and all 8 dual-task walking speed assessments (P<.05). The Total II score was strongly associated with the dual tasks of walking on a straight path while counting backward and crossing over an obstacle (r=0.698, r=0.697, respectively; P<.05). According to multiple linear regression, only the dual task of walking while counting backward was significantly associated with the Total II score (P<.05). The dual-task walking speed assessments, which involved walking and performing a secondary task such as counting backward or crossing an obstacle on a straight path, were highly indicative of cognitive decline. The combination of results from both tasks may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive decline compared with relying solely on a single-task assessment.",

Disease-modifying therapies for this disabling neuropsychiatric condition are critically needed. To identify drugs associated with the risk of developing Lewy body dementia, we performed a population-based case-control study of 148 170 US Medicare participants diagnosed with Lewy body dementia between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2014 and of 1 253 043 frequency-matched controls. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of Lewy body dementia risk with 1017 prescription drugs overall and separately for the three major racial groups (Black, Hispanic and White Americans). We identified significantly reduced Lewy body dementia risk associated with drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases (anti-hypertensives: odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.70-0.74, P-value = 0; cholesterol-lowering agents: odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.83-0.87, P-value = 0; anti-diabetics: odds ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.72, P-value = 0). Notably, anti-diabetic medications were associated with a larger risk reduction among Black Lewy body dementia patients compared with other racial groups (Black: odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.72, P-value = 0; Hispanic: odds ratio = 0.86, 95% = 0.80-0.92, P-value = 5.16 \u00d7 10-5; White: odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.82-0.88, P-value = 0). To independently confirm the epidemiological findings, we looked for evidence of genetic overlap between Lewy body dementia and cardiovascular traits using whole-genome sequence data generated for 2591 Lewy body dementia patients and 4027 controls. Bivariate mixed modelling identified shared genetic risk between Lewy body dementia and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. By combining epidemiological and genomic data, we demonstrated that drugs treating cardiovascular diseases are associated with reduced Lewy body dementia risk, and these associations varied across racial groups. Future randomized clinical trials need to confirm our findings, but our data suggest that assiduous management of cardiovascular diseases may be beneficial in this understudied form of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Pre-symptomatic screening is getting more attention in healthcare as it detects the risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is very useful for treatment or prevention. AD screening could play an important role in individuals with at least one affected first-degree relative, but also without family history. As the demand for screening is rising worldwide, it is important to consider possible cross-cultural differences in attitudes toward pre-symptomatic screening in order to tailor healthcare services to the needs of each country. Objective: This study aims to investigate the attitudes of family members and non-family members of people with dementia toward pre-symptomatic screening and explore possible differences in attitudes across five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Turkey) using translated versions of the \"Perceptions regarding pRE-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Screening\" questionnaire (PRE-ADS). Methods: The multicultural sample (N = 650) was recruited from samples that were previously used in validation studies of the translated PRE-ADS versions. The subscale \"Acceptability of Screening\", consisting of five PRE-ADS items to specifically explore willingness to undergo screening, was created. \u0399nternal consistency was measured, and structural validity was determined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Group comparisons were performed to investigate differences in attitudes toward pre-symptomatic AD screening regarding family history and country of origin using the PRE-ADS and the \"Acceptability of Screening\" mean scores. Results: Construct validity was acceptable for the PRE-ADS. Both the PRE-ADS (\u03b1 = 0.76) and its subscale \"Acceptability of Screening\" (\u03b1 = 0.90) had good internal consistency. Overall, 56.9% of the total sample expressed a positive intention toward pre-symptomatic AD screening. T-tests showed significantly higher mean scores of participants with an affected family member. An international comparison revealed differences in the \"Acceptability of Screening\" mean score across the five European countries. No cross-cultural differences were found for the PRE-ADS mean score after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusion: The PRE-ADS and its subscale are reliable tools for assessing pre-symptomatic AD screening attitudes. Variations in the acceptability of screening seem to be linked to family history and cultural influences. Further research with larger samples is needed to explore underlying relationships.",

Our objective was to describe trends in kidney transplant volumes over time to inform the development of a hypothesis regarding the impact of the Illinois Transplant Fund on kidney transplant volumes for adult Hispanic patients with kidney failure in Illinois, especially noncitizen patients. Retrospective study. We used data on the annual number of kidney transplants and kidney failure prevalence aggregated to the national and state levels from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and United States Renal Data System, respectively. The annual number of transplants as a percentage of prevalent kidney failure cases among adults over time from 2010 to 2020 by race/ethnicity for all payer and private insurance-paid transplants and the annual number of transplants by citizenship status (for Hispanic patients only) were examined for the United States (US), Illinois, and 6 selected US states. Descriptive study. From pre- to post-Illinois Transplant Fund, the average annual number of transplants as a percentage of the average annual prevalent kidney failure cases for Hispanic adults increased by 4% in Illinois while the same figure increased by 33% for privately insured transplants. The observations reported in this paper cannot be interpreted as evidence for the program's impact. Observed trends suggest plausibility of developing a hypothesis that Illinois Transplant Fund's introduction may have contributed to improvement in kidney transplantation access for Hispanic patients in Illinois, especially noncitizens, but cannot constitute evidence in support of or against this hypothesis. Future research should test whether the Illinois Transplant Fund improved access to kidney transplants for noncitizens with kidney failure. Health policies regarding kidney transplant access for undocumented residents vary widely by state. The Illinois Transplant Fund (ITF) provides financial support for health insurance premiums, so undocumented patients with kidney failure in Illinois can qualify for a kidney transplant. In this study, we reported kidney transplant trends in Illinois before and after the creation of the ITF along with kidney transplant trends in the US overall and selected states that share similarities to Illinois.",

The recent addition to the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 of robust dementia outcomes enabled us to assess the prognostic value of MCR for dementia and explore the various trajectories of participants diagnosed with MCR. We classified 680 community-dwelling participants free from dementia into non-MCR or MCR groups at mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years. We used Cox and competing risk regression methods, adjusted for potential confounders, to evaluate the risk of developing all-cause incident dementia over 10 years of follow-up. Secondarily, we followed the trajectories for individuals with and without MCR at baseline and categorised them into subgroups based on whether MCR was still present at the next research wave, three years later. The presence of MCR increased the risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR 2.34, 95%CI 1.14-4.78, p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), as did fewer years of education and higher depression symptoms. However, MCR has a heterogenous progression trajectory. The MCR progression subgroups each have different prognostic values for incident dementia. MCR showed similar prognostic ability for dementia in a Scottish cohort as for other populations. MCR could identify a target group for early interventions of modifiable risk factors to prevent incident dementia. This study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of MCR progression.

In AD, A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain parenchyma as soluble oligomers and protofibrils, and its aggregation process further give rise to amyloid plaques. Compelling evidence now indicate that A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2o) are the most toxic forms responsible for neuronal and synaptic alterations. Recently, we showed that the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) counteracts A\u03b2o-induced synaptic alterations and that a peptide derived from VEGF is able to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation process. Moreover, VEGF has been reported to promote microglial chemotaxis to A\u03b2 brain deposits. We therefore investigated whether VEGF could influence microglial phagocytic response to A\u03b2, using in vitro and ex vivo models of amyloid accumulation. We report here that VEGF increases A\u03b2o phagocytosis by microglial cells and further characterized the molecular basis of the VEGF effect. VEGF is able to control \u03b1-secretase activity in microglial cells, resulting in the increased cleavage of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a major microglial A\u03b2 receptor. Consistently, the soluble form sTREM2 also increases A\u03b2o phagocytosis by microglial cells. Taken together, these findings propose VEGF as a new regulator of A\u03b2 clearance and suggest its potential role in rescuing compromised microglial function in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The accumulation of neurofibrillary tau tangles, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), occurs in medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions early in the disease process, with some of the earliest deposits localized to subregions of the entorhinal cortex. Although functional specialization of entorhinal cortex subregions has been reported, few studies have considered functional associations with localized tau accumulation. In this study, stepwise linear regressions were used to examine the contributions of regional tau burden in specific MTL subregions, as measured by 18F-MK6240 PET, to individual variability in cognition. Dependent measures of interest included the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and composite scores of delayed episodic memory and language. Other model variables included age, sex, education, APOE4 status, and global amyloid burden, indexed by 11C-PiB. Tau burden in right Brodmann area 35 (BA35), left and right Brodmann area 36 (BA36), and age each uniquely contributed to the proportion of explained variance in CDR-SB scores, while right BA36 and age were also significant predictors of MMSE scores, and right BA36 was significantly associated with delayed episodic memory performance. Tau burden in both left and right BA36, along with education, uniquely contributed to the proportion of explained variance in language composite scores. Importantly, the addition of more inclusive ROIs, encompassing less granular segmentation of the entorhinal cortex, did not significantly contribute to explained variance in cognition across any of the models. These findings suggest that the ability to quantify tau burden in more refined MTL subregions may better account for individual differences in cognition, which may improve the identification of non-demented older adults who are on a trajectory of decline due to AD.",

(1) There was a significant age by sex interaction on MWF of the fornix (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and CgC (p\u2009=\u20090.005), but not the CgH (p\u2009=\u20090.192); as age increased, MWF decreased in women but not men. (2) Fornix MWF was associated with both learning and recall (ps\u2009<\u20090.01), but MWF of the two cingulum regions were not (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Results were unchanged when adjusting for hippocampal volume. The current work adds to the literature by illuminating sex differences in age-related myelin decline using a measure sensitive to myelin and may help facilitate detection of AD risk for women.",

The purpose of this study was to explore differences of gray-white matter boundary Z-score (gwBZ) and its tissue volume (gwBTV) between patients with AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) elderly participants. Three-dimensional T1-weight images of a total of 227 participants were prospectively obtained from our institute from 2006 to 2022 to map gwBZ and gwBTV on images. Statistical analyses of gwBZ and gwBTV were performed to compare the three groups (AD, MCI, CN), to assess their correlations with age and Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and to evaluate their effects on AD classification in the hippocampus. This study included 62 CN participants (71.8 \u00b1 4.8 years, 20 males, 42 females), 72 MCI participants (72.6 \u00b1 5.1 years, 23 males, 49 females), and 93 AD participants (73.6 \u00b1 7.7 years, 22 males, 71 females). The AD group had lower gwBZ and gwBTV than CN and MCI groups. K-MMSE showed positive correlations with gwBZ and gwBTV whereas age showed negative correlations with gwBZ and gwBTV. The combination of gwBZ or gwBTV with K-MMSE had a high accuracy in classifying AD from CN in the hippocampus with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.972 for both. gwBZ and gwBTV were reduced in AD. They were correlated with cognitive function and age. Moreover, gwBZ or gwBTV combined with K-MMSE had a high accuracy in differentiating AD from CN in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that evaluating gwBZ and gwBTV in AD brain could be a useful tool for monitoring AD progression and diagnosis.",

This study aims to examine the impact of Andro-III on enhancing cognitive learning ability in 3xTg-AD mice, as well as the mechanisms involved. Andro-III improved spatial learning ability, prevented the loss of Nysted's vesicles, reduced the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau proteins, and suppressed microglial activation. Further research found that the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B RelA (NF-\u03baB p65) expression and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) activity were inhibited, while CREB was upregulated in brain tissue treated with Andro-III.

However, the anti-AD molecular mechanism of SZRD remains to be further investigated. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of SZRD's improvement in AD's neuronal loss, synaptic damage and ferroptosis by regulating DJ-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. LC-MS/MS was used to detect the active ingredients from SZRD. APP/PS1 mice was treated with SZRD and a ferroptosis inhibitor (Liproxstatin-1), respectively. Upon the completion of behavioral tests, Nissl staining, FJB staining, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were preformed to evaluate the effects of SZRD on neuronal loss, synaptic damage, A\u03b2 deposition. Iron staining, transmission electron microscopy, and iron assay kit was performed to estimate the effects of SZRD on ferroptosis. SOD kit, MDA kit, GSH kit, and GSH/GSSG kit were utilized to measure the oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus. The protein expression of TfR1, FTH1, FTL, FPN1, DJ-1, Nrf2, GPX4, SLC7A11, and ACSL4 were detected by Western blot. A total of 16 active ingredients were identified from SZRD extract. SZRD SZRD significantly alleviated learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. SZRD improved the hippocampal neuronal loss and degenerated neurons in APP/PS1 mice via inhibiting the A\u03b2 deposit. SZRD mitigated the hippocampal synaptic damage in APP/PS1 mice. SZRD inhibited iron accumulation, and alleviated the oxidative stress level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.

Currently, three types of MDPs have been identified: Humanin (HN), MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within Twelve S rRNA type-c), and SHLP1-6 (small Humanin-like peptide, 1 to 6). The 12\u00a0S ribosomal RNA (MT-RNR1) gene harbors the sequence for MOTS-c, whereas HN and SHLP1-6 are encoded by the 16\u00a0S ribosomal RNA (MT-RNR2) gene. Special genetic codes are used in mtDNA as compared to nuclear DNA: (i) ATA and ATT are used as start codons in addition to the standard start codon ATG; (ii) AGA and AGG are used as stop codons instead of coding for arginine; (iii) the standard stop codon UGA is used to code for tryptophan. While HN, SHLP6, and MOTS-c are encoded by the H (heavy owing to high guanine + thymine base composition)-strand of the mtDNA, SHLP1-5 are encoded by the L (light owing to less guanine + thymine base composition)-strand.

        "AbstractText": "The histamine H3 receptor (H3R) is a neurotransmitter receptor that is primarily found in the brain, where it controls the release and synthesis of histamine, as well as the release of other neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin). Notably, 20 H3R isoforms are differentially expressed in the human brain as a consequence of alternative gene splicing. The hH3R-445, -415, -365 and -329 isoforms contain the prototypical GPCR (7TM) structure, yet exhibit deletions in the third intracellular loop, a structural domain that is pivotal for G protein-coupling, signaling and regulation. To date, the physiological relevance underlying the individual and combinatorial function of hH3R isoforms remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, given their significant implication in physiological processes (e.g. cognition, homeostasis) and neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia), widespread targeting of hH3R isoforms by drugs may lead to on-target side effects in brain regions that are unaffected by disease. To this end, isoform- and/or pathway-selective targeting of hH3R isoforms by biased agonists could be of therapeutic relevance for the development of region- and disease-specific drugs. Hence, we have evaluated ligand biased signaling at the hH3R-445, -415, -365 and -329 isoforms across various G\u03b1i/o-mediated (i.e. [35S]GTP\u03b3S accumulation, cAMP inhibition, pERK1/2 activation, pAKT T308/S473 activation) and non G\u03b1i/o-mediated (i.e. \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment) endpoints that are relevant to neurological diseases. Our findings indicate that H3R agonists display significantly altered patterns in their degree of ligand bias, in a pathway- and isoform-dependent manner, underlining the significance to investigate GPCRs with multiple isoforms to improve development of selective drugs.

The mechanism and signaling route, however, remain unclear. This research aimed to investigate the impact of IGF-1 on AD as well as its possible mechanism and signaling route. In this work, intracerebroventricular AAV9-IGF-1 was delivered to APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Following therapy, the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were administered to evaluate spatial learning and memory. The elevated plus maze, the open field test, and the sucrose preference test were used to evaluate anxious-depressive-like behavior. Thioflavin S staining was employed to visualize A\u03b2 deposition, and ELISA was used to determine the quantities of soluble A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42. Transmission electron microscopy was used to view the mitochondrial structure and mitophagy vesicles. The protein expression levels of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3-II/LC3-I were finally determined by Western blotting. AAV9-IGF-1 therapy enhanced spatial learning and memory, relieved anxious-depressive-like behavior impairments, lowered amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, and decreased levels of soluble A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42. In addition, AAV9-IGF-1 therapy restored mitochondrial integrity and increased the number of mitophagy in transgenic mice expressing APP/PS1.

This was paralleled by the transcriptional rearrangement of hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth, with a pervasive alteration of metabolic, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial gene signatures, accompanied by a delay in the maturation of CA1 neurons.

S100\u03b2 protein belongs to group of small calcium regulators of cell membrane channels and pumps that are expressed by astrocytes and is hypothesised to play and have a relevant role in AD development. We analysed the selective differentiation of S100\u03b2-positive astrocytes into Glutamine synthetase (GS) and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive sub-groups in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD triple transgenic animal model (3xTg-AD).

We fitted 10 mediation models using structural equation modeling to investigate this in a cohort of 137 healthy adults, aged 40-80 years, from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation (DDI) study. Here, t-tau and NfL were defined as mediators between age and different cognitive tests.

        "AbstractText": "We conducted a cross-national comparison of the association between main lifetime occupational skills and later-life cognitive function across four economically and socially distinct countries. Data were from population-based studies of aging and their Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocols (HCAPs) in the US, South Africa, India, and Mexico (N\u00a0=\u00a010,037; Age range: 50 to 105 years; 2016 to 2020). Main lifetime occupational skill was classified according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations. Weighted, adjusted regression models estimated pooled and country-specific associations between main lifetime occupational skill and later-life general cognitive function in men and women. We observed positive gradients between occupational skill and later-life cognitive function for men and women in the US and Mexico, a positive gradient for women but not men in India, and no association for men or women in South Africa. Main lifetime occupations may be a source of later-life cognitive reserve, with cross-national heterogeneity in this association. No studies have examined cross-national differences in the association of occupational skill with cognition. We used data from Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocols in the US, Mexico, India, and South Africa. The association of occupational skill with cognitive function varies by country and gender.",

        "AbstractText": "Protein aggregation is invariably associated with the inflammation as a factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the interaction between downstream factors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and inflammation, with implications in cognitive impairment in AD. Amyloid-\u03b2\u00a0(A\u03b2)(1-42) was administered by bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection in the brain of adult male Wistar rats to experimentally develop AD. The cognitive impairment was assessed by measuring behavioral parameters such as Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in different rat brain regions. Inflammatory marker proteins such as cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B\u00a0(NF-\u041aB) (p65) were measured by the western blotting. Gene expression of ER stress downstream factors such as ATF-4, CHOP, and GADD-34 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Histological studies were performed to check A\u03b2 accumulation and neuronal degeneration. Integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) was used to confirm the specific role of ER stress-mediated inflammation in cognitive impairment. Administration of A\u03b2(1-42) resulted in alteration in levels of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory proteins, and mRNA levels of ER stress downstream factors. ISRIB treatment resulted in attenuation of A\u03b2(1-42)-induced ER stress, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in rats. These results indicate that ER stress-mediated inflammation potentiates the cognitive impairment in AD. An understanding of cascade of events, interaction of ER stress which was a hallmark of the present investigation together with inflammation and modulation of downstream signalling factors could serve as potent biomarkers to study AD progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease, and approximately 10% of AD cases are early-onset familial AD (EOFAD), which is mainly linked to point mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS1 and PS2). Mutations in PS2 are extremely rare and have not received enough attention. Recently, studies have found that Rho GTPase activity is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing in PS2 siRNA-transfected SH-SY5Y cells and found a group of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the regulation of GTPase activity. Among those DEGs, the most significantly downregulated was Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 (ARHGEF5). GTPase activity in PS2 siRNA-transfected cells was significantly decreased. Then, we found that the expression of ARHGEF5 and the GTPase activity of Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (Miro2) in PS2 D439A mutant SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased. We found for the first time that PS2 can bind to Miro2, and the PS2 D439A mutation reduced the binding between PS2 and Miro2, reduced the expression of Miro2, and resulted in an imbalance in mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics. In conclusion, PS2 gene knockdown may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through the regulation of GTPase activity. The imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics mediated by the PS2 D439A mutation through regulation of the expression and GTPase activity of Miro2 may be a potential pathogenic mechanism of AD.",

Ninety Alzheimer's patients, who were divided into three groups as Stage I (n=42), Stage II (n=29), and Stage III (n=19), based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, were included in the study. Cognitive status of the patients was evaluated with Standardized Mini-Mental Test (SMMT) at baseline and repeated 6 months later. Clinical periodontal examinations were recorded and occlusal relationship status was classified according to the Eichner Index. Of 90 Alzheimer's patients, 65 were toothed individuals with periodontitis and 25 were edentulous individuals without active periodontal disease. Stage II and Stage III toothed Alzheimer's patients had higher percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP%) and clinical attachment level (CAL) values than Stage I patients (p<0.05). Stage III Alzheimer's patients had significantly higher probing pocket depth (PPD) values than Stage I individuals (p<0.05). \u0394SMMT values showed positive correlation with BOP% (r=0.308, p=0.013) and PPD (r=0.275, p=0.027). Among the evaluated parameters, being in the AD Stage II-Stage III, having periodontitis and age variable had significant effects on \u0394SMMT levels (p<0.05). Within the limits of our study, it can be concluded that periodontitis may increase the severity and also accelerate the progression rate of AD. These results are precious to show the necessity of proper oral hygiene activities and regular dental visits in patients with toothed AD.

        "AbstractText": "Plasma-to-autopsy studies are essential for validation of blood biomarkers and understanding their relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Few such studies have been done on phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and those that exist have made limited or no comparison of the different p-tau variants. This study is the first to use immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to compare the accuracy of eight different plasma tau species in predicting autopsy-confirmed AD. The sample included 123 participants (AD\u2009=\u200969, non-AD\u2009=\u200954) from the Boston University Alzheimer's disease Research Center who had an available ante-mortem plasma sample and donated their brain. Plasma samples proximate to death were analyzed by targeted IP-MS for six different tryptic phosphorylated (p-tau-181, 199, 202, 205, 217, 231), and two non-phosphorylated tau (195-205, 212-221) peptides. NIA-Reagan Institute criteria were used for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Binary logistic regressions tested the association between each plasma peptide and autopsy-confirmed AD status. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics were generated using predicted probabilities from the logistic regression models. Odds Ratio (OR) was used to study associations between the different plasma tau species and CERAD and Braak classifications. All tau species were increased in AD compared to non-AD, but p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 (AUC\u2009=\u200989.8), p-tau231 (AUC\u2009=\u200983.4), and p-tau205 (AUC\u2009=\u200981.3) all had excellent accuracy in discriminating AD from non-AD brain donors, even among those with CDR\u2009<\u20091). Furthermore, p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest ORs with both CERAD (ORp-tau217\u2009=\u200915.29, ORp-tau205\u2009=\u20095.05 and ORp-tau231\u2009=\u20093.86) and Braak staging (ORp-tau217\u2009=\u200914.29, ORp-tau205\u2009=\u20095.27 and ORp-tau231\u2009=\u20094.02) but presented increased levels at different amyloid and tau stages determined by neuropathological examination. Our findings support plasma p-tau217 as the most promising p-tau species for detecting AD brain pathology. Plasma p-tau231 and p-tau205 may additionally function as markers for different stages of the disease.",

Here, we investigate the function of APP and its proteolytic cleavage by ADAM10 in the pathogenesis of TSCC. A total of 63 TSCC patients and 30 healthy controls were included and the results of IHC assay showed high expressions of ADAM10 and APP in TSCC tissues compared to paired para-carcinoma tissues. Interestingly, APP expression in TSCC patients was correlated with ADAM10 expression and their combined expression was related to the poor patients' survival. We found that APP was \u0251-cleaved in TSCC cells to form sAPP\u03b1, and the serum level of sAPP\u03b1 but not sAPP\u03b2 in TSCC patients was higher than healthy controls. Both overexpression with full-length APP and sAPP\u03b1 promoted TSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Downregulation of APP or ADAM10 by siRNA decreased the generation of sAPP\u03b1 and inhibited the activity of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways, thereby reducing TSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Treatment with ERK1/2 or p38 agonist or sAPP\u03b1 overexpression reversed the effects of APP or ADAM10 knockdown. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the pathogenic roles of APP cleaved by ADAM10 to activate ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in TSCC cells. Both high expressions of ADAM10 and APP were related to poor prognosis. Targeting APP cleaved by ADAM10 might be a potential strategy in TSCC treatment.",

Likewise, acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate cerebral atrophy is not straightforward, as prolonged scanning times are less tolerated in this population. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be obtained faster, but poor contrast resolution limits its function for morphometric analysis. We implemented an automated analysis of CT scans to characterize differences across dementia stages in a cross-sectional study of an adult DS cohort. CT scans of 98 individuals were analyzed using an automatic algorithm. Voxel-based correlations with clinical dementia stages and AD plasma biomarkers (phosphorylated tau-181 and neurofilament light chain) were identified, and their dysconnectomic patterns delineated. Dementia severity was negatively correlated with gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes in temporal lobe regions, including parahippocampal gyri. Dysconnectome analysis revealed an association between WM loss and temporal lobe GM volume reduction. AD biomarkers were negatively associated with GM volume in hippocampal and cingulate gyri. Our automated algorithm and novel dysconnectomic analysis of CT scans successfully described brain morphometric differences related to AD in adults with DS, providing a new avenue for neuroimaging analysis in populations for whom magnetic resonance imaging is difficult to obtain.",

There is currently no effective treatment for the onset and/or progression of the pathophysiological diseases of AD. The global prevalence of this disease has increased in recent years due to modern lifestyle. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a drug with significant neuroprotective potential. Since plant metabolites, especially polyphenols, have important pharmacological properties acting against \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), Tau, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, such phytochemicals were selected in the present research. Using the Schr\u00f6dinger tool (Maestro V.13.6), the drug potency of these metabolites was studied after installation in the highly configured workstation. Among the 120 polyphenols docked, amygdalin showed notable docking values of\u2009-\u200911.2638, followed by eriocitrin (-\u200910.9569), keracyanin (-\u200910.7086), and amaroswerin (-\u20099.48126).

In the absorption and distribution assessment, these phytochemicals showed significantly better values than the inhibitors CNP520. The chosen phytochemicals have been demonstrated as non-hepatotoxic; however, the BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 is hepatotoxic. In both the molecular docking and ADMET assessments, these natural chemicals have shown optimism as potential drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.

Altered empathic mechanisms observed in AD may be a consequence of cognitive impairment, more specifically of reduced mental flexibility and self-regulation. The present study explored possible changes in empathy for subjects in the prodromal phase of AD, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and of their neural substrates. Eighteen MCI patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) questionnaire was administered to each participant. The IRI encompasses four factors: Perspective Taking; Fantasy; Empathic Concern; Personal Distress. MCI patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging structural examination and were compared to 30 healthy controls (HC-MRI). A limited number of cortical and subcortical regions involved in social cognition was selected as regions of interest (ROIs). MCI individuals obtained lower scores than HC in the Perspective Taking and Fantasy subscales of the IRI, whereas they obtained higher scores on Empathic Concern. Regarding neuroimaging data, a significant correlation emerged between IRI scores and the neural measurements of different regions involved in empathy, especially covering the temporoparietal junction, which is a critical region engaged in both affective and cognitive dimensions of empathy. The results of the present study suggest that a subtle impairment in regulatory mechanisms of empathy may occur very early during the course of AD, possibly as a consequence of neuropathological changes occurring in brain regions involved in social cognition.",

In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40\u00a0years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth.",

Currently, the MR1/MAIT cell axis has been investigated in only a few neurological diseases including, multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, brain cancer/tumors, ischemia, cerebral palsy, general aging and, most recently, Alzheimer's disease. Each of these diseases demonstrates a role for this under-studied innate immune axis in its neuropathology. Together, they highlight the importance of studying the MR1/MAIT cell axis in CNS disorders. Here, we review the contributions of the MR1/MAIT cell axis in the progression or remission of these neurological diseases. This work has shed some light in terms of potentially exploiting the MR1/MAIT cell axis in novel therapeutic applications.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A multiclass extreme gradient boosting model for evaluation of transcriptomic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease prediction.",
        "AbstractText": "Patients with young-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) (before the age of 50\u00a0years old) often lack obvious imaging changes and amyloid protein deposition, which can lead to misdiagnosis with other cognitive impairments. Considering the association between immunological dysfunction and progression of neurodegenerative disease, recent research has focused on identifying blood transcriptomic signatures for precise prediction of AD. In this study, we extracted blood biomarkers from large-scale transcriptomics to construct multiclass eXtreme Gradient Boosting models (XGBoost), and evaluated their performance in distinguishing AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Independent testing with external dataset revealed that the combination of blood transcriptomic signatures achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of 0.81 for multiclass classification (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.81; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.63), 0.83 for classification of AD vs. CN (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.72; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.73), and 0.85 for classification of AD vs. MCI (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.77; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.73). These candidate signatures were significantly enriched in 62 chromosome regions, such as Chr.19p12-19p13.3, Chr.1p22.1-1p31.1, and Chr.1q21.2-1p23.1 (adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and significantly overrepresented by 26 transcription factors, including E2F2, FOXO3, and GATA1 (adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Biological analysis of these signatures pointed to systemic dysregulation of immune responses, hematopoiesis, exocytosis, and neuronal support in neurodegenerative disease (adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Blood transcriptomic biomarkers hold great promise in clinical use for the accurate assessment and prediction of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuropsychiatric or behavioral symptoms of dementia encompass a series of disorders, such as anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, and agitation, all commonly present in individuals living with dementia. While they are not required for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they are ubiquitously present in all stages of the disease, contributing to negative clinical outcomes, including cognitive decline, functional disability, and caregiver burden. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been conceptualized not only as risk factors but as clinical markers of decline along the AD spectrum. The concept of \"mild behavioral impairment\", the behavioral correlate of mild cognitive impairment, has been proposed within this framework. The first steps in the management of behavioral symptoms in AD involve defining the target and investigating potential causes and/or aggravating factors. Once these factors are addressed, non-pharmacological approaches are preferred as first-line interventions. Following the optimization of anticholinesterase treatments, specific pharmacological approaches (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) can be considered weighing potential side effects.

As the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is critical for episodic memory13,14,15,16 and is affected by \u03b2-amyloid accumulation in early AD,17,18,19,20,21 we address this question by performing Ca2+ imaging in RSC parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons during a contextual fear memory task in healthy control mice and the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that populations of PV interneurons responsive to aversive electric foot shocks during contextual fear conditioning (shock-responsive) significantly decreased in the 5XFAD mice, indicating dysfunctions in the recruitment of memory-encoding PV interneurons. In the control mice, ensemble activities of shock-responsive PV interneurons were selectively upregulated during the freezing epoch of the contextual fear memory retrieval, manifested by synaptic potentiation of PV interneuron-mediated inhibition. However, such changes in ensemble dynamics during memory retrieval and synaptic plasticity were both absent in the 5XFAD mice. Optogenetic silencing of PV interneurons during contextual fear conditioning in the control mice mimicked the memory deficits in the 5XFAD mice, while optogenetic activation of PV interneurons in the 5XFAD mice restored memory retrieval. These results demonstrate the critical roles of contextual fear memory-encoding PV interneurons for memory retrieval. Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction of PV interneurons may disrupt the recruitment of PV interneurons and their ensemble dynamics underlying contextual fear memory retrieval, subsequently leading to memory deficits in AD.",

Although it has been reported that nervonic acid may play a role in the recovery of human cognitive impairment, its specific mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the results of serum biochemical indexes showed that nervonic acid improved inflammation and reduced amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) deposition and tau protein phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. Subsequently, we further used a metabolomics approach to investigate the potential mechanism of action of nervonic acid in the treatment of AD. The results of serum and urine metabolomics study showed that the intervention of nervonic acid significantly reversed the metabolic profile disorder in AD rats. A total of 52 metabolites were identified. They mainly involved linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, and all these metabolic pathways were associated with the emergence of inflammation in vivo. It suggests that the therapeutic effect of nervonic acid on AD is likely to be produced by ameliorating inflammation. The results obtained in this study provide new insights into the mechanism of nervonic acid treatment of AD and lay a foundation for the clinical application of nervonic acid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) is another Nogo receptor that also binds to major histocompatibility complex I and \u03b2-amyloid and suppresses dendritic immune cell functions and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system. Augmenting structural and functional neural plasticity by manipulating the Nogo signaling pathway is a novel promising strategy for treating brain ischemia and degenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease. In recent decades psychiatric research using experimental animals has focused on the attenuation of neural plasticity by stress loadings and on the enhanced resilience by psychopharmacological treatments. In the present study, we examined possible expressional alterations in Nogo signal-related proteins in the rat hippocampus after behavioral stress loadings and antidepressant treatments. To validate the effectiveness of the procedures, previously reported increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by ECS or ketamine administration and decrease of BDNF by stress loadings are also shown in the present study. Significant increases in hippocampal NgR1 and PirB expression were observed following chronic variable stress, and a significant increase in NgR1 expression was observed under a single prolonged stress paradigm. These results indicate a possible contribution of enhanced Nogo signaling to the attenuation of neural plasticity in response to stressful experiences. Additionally, the suppression of hippocampal NgR1 expression using electroconvulsive seizure treatment and administration of subanesthetic dose of ketamine supported the increased neural plasticity induced by the antidepressant treatments.",

We used tacrine to modify the aliphatic substituent, and employed rivastigmine, indole and sibiriline fragments as carrier scaffolds. The majority of compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity for cholinesterase. Notably, compound C7 with sibiriline fragment exhibited potent inhibitory activities against human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE, IC50\u00a0=\u00a030.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.07\u00a0nM) and human butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE, IC50\u00a0=\u00a048.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.41\u00a0nM) with minimal neurotoxicity. Further investigations have demonstrated that C7 exhibited a remarkable capacity to safeguard PC12\u00a0cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis and effectively suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, in an inflammation model of BV2 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), C7 effectively attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. After 12\u00a0h of dialysis, C7 continued to exhibit an inhibitory effect on cholinesterase activity. An acute toxicity test in vivo demonstrated that C7 exhibited a superior safety profile and no hepatotoxicity compared to the parent nucleus tacrine. In the scopolamine-induced AD mouse model, C7 (20\u00a0mg/kg) significantly reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain of the mice. C7 was tested in a pharmacological AD mouse model induced by A\u03b21-42 and attenuated memory deficits at doses as low as 5\u00a0mg/kg.

However, the impact of AD on spoken discourse and the associated neuroanatomical correlates have mainly been studied in populations with higher levels of education, although preliminary evidence seems to indicate that socioeconomic status (SES) and level of education have an impact on spoken discourse. The purpose of this study was to analyze microstructural variables in spoken discourse in people with AD with low-to-middle SES and low level of education and to study their association with gray matter (GM) density. Nine women with AD and 10 matched (age, SES, and education) women without brain injury (WWBI) underwent a neuropsychological assessment, which included two spoken discourse tasks, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Microstructural variables were extracted from the discourse samples using NILC-Metrix software. Brain density, measured by voxel-based morphometry, was compared between groups and then correlated with the differentiating microstructural variables. The AD group produced a lower diversity of verbal time moods and fewer words and sentences than WWBI but a greater diversity of pronouns, prepositions, and lexical richness. At the neural level, the AD group presented a lower GM density bilaterally in the hippocampus, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus. Number of words and sentences produced were associated with GM density in the left parahippocampal gyrus, whereas the diversity of verbal moods was associated with the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate gyrus bilaterally. The present findings are mainly consistent with previous studies conducted in groups with higher levels of SES and education, but they suggest that atrophy in the left inferior temporal gyrus could be critical in AD in populations with lower levels of SES and education. This research provides evidence on the importance of pursuing further studies including people with various SES and education levels. Spoken discourse has been shown to be affected in Alzheimer disease, but most studies have been conducted on individuals with middle-to-high SES and high educational levels. The study reports on microstructural measures of spoken discourse in groups of women in the early stage of AD and healthy women, with low-to-middle SES and lower levels of education.

Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self-stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self-assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC-EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo-sensitive release of MSC-EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC-EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease.

Persons with dementia and their informal caregivers (ie, dyads) experience high rates of emotional distress and negative health outcomes. Several barriers prevent dyads from engaging in psychosocial care including cost, transportation, and a lack of treatments that target later stages of dementia and target the dyad together. Technologically informed treatment and serious gaming have been shown to be feasible and effective among persons living with dementia and their care partners. To increase access, there is a need for technologically informed psychosocial interventions which target the dyad, together in the home. This study aims to develop the toolkit for experiential well-being in dementia, a dyadic, \"bio-experiential\" intervention for persons with dementia and their caregivers. Per our conceptual model, the toolkit for experiential well-being in dementia platform aims to target sustained attention, positive emotions, and active engagement among dyads. In this paper, we outline the protocol and conceptual model for intervention development and partnership with design and development experts. We followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model (stage 1A) and supplemented the model with principles of user-centered design. The first step includes understanding user needs, goals, and strengths. We met this step by engaging in methodology and definition synthesis and conducting focus groups with dementia care providers (N=10) and persons with dementia and caregivers (N=11). Step 2 includes developing and refining the prototype. We will meet this step by engaging dyads in up to 20 iterations of platform \u03b2 testing workshops. Step 3 includes observing user interactions with the prototype. We will meet this step by releasing the platform for feasibility testing. Key takeaways from the focus groups include balancing individualization and the dyadic relationship and avoiding confusing stimuli. As of September 2023, we have completed focus groups with providers, persons with dementia, and their caregivers. Additionally, we have conducted 4 iterations of \u03b2 testing workshops with dyads. Feedback from focus groups informed the \u03b2 testing workshops; data have not yet been formally analyzed and will be reported in future publications. Technological interventions, particularly \"bio-experiential\" technology, can be used in dementia care to support emotional health among persons with a diagnosis and caregivers.

Using [18F]FDG PET scans for voxel-based analysis, we explored correlations between regional brain metabolism metrics and CSF NPTX2 levels in MCI-AD patients, accounting for age. Baseline and follow-up MMSE scores were lower in LMCI than EMCI (p value\u2009=\u20090.006 and p\u2009<\u20090.001). EMCI exhibited significantly higher CSF NPTX2 values than both LMCI (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and OND (p\u2009=\u20090.006). We found a significant positive correlation between NPTX2 values and metabolism of bilateral precuneus in MCI-AD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.005 at voxel level, p\u2009<\u20090.05 with family-wise error correction at the cluster level). Higher CSF NPTX2 in EMCI compared to controls and LMCI suggests compensatory synaptic responses to initial AD pathology. Disease progression sees these mechanisms overwhelmed, lowering CSF NPTX2 approaching dementia. Positive CSF NPTX2 correlation with precuneus glucose metabolism links to AD-related metabolic changes across MCI course. These findings posit CSF NPTX2 as a promising biomarker for both AD staging and progression risk stratification.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite research demonstrating the risks of using feeding tubes in persons with advanced dementia, they continue to be placed. The natural history of dysphagia among patients with advanced dementia has not been examined. We conducted a secondary analysis of a national cohort of persons with advanced dementia staying at a nursing home stay before hospitalization to examine (1) pre-hospitalization dysphagia prevalence and (2) risk of feeding tube placement during hospitalization based on preexisting dysphagia. A retrospective cohort study consisting of all nursing home (NH) residents (\u226566\u2009years) with advanced dementia (Cognitive Function Scale score \u22652), a hospitalization between 2013-2017, and a Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessment within 120\u2009days before hospitalization. Pre-hospitalization dysphagia status and surgically placed feeding tube insertion during hospitalization were determined by MDS 3.0 swallowing items and ICD-9 codes, respectively. A multivariate logistic model clustering on hospital was used to examine the association of dysphagia with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube placement after adjustment for confounders. Between 2013 and 2017, 889,983 persons with NH stay with advanced dementia (mean age: 84.5, SD: 7.5, and 63.5% female) were hospitalized. Pre-hospitalization dysphagia was documented in 5.4% (n\u2009=\u200947,574) and characterized by oral dysphagia (n\u2009=\u200921,438, 2.4%), pharyngeal dysphagia (n\u2009=\u200924,257, 2.7%), and general swallowing complaints/pain (n\u2009=\u200914,928, 1.7%). Overall, PEG feeding tubes were placed in 3529 patients (11.2%) with pre-hospitalization dysphagia, whereas 27,893 (88.8%) did not have pre-hospitalization dysphagia according to MDS 3.0 items. Feeding tube placement risk increased with the number of dysphagia items noted on the pre-hospitalization MDS (6 vs. 0 dysphagia variables: OR\u2009=\u20095.43, 95% CI: 3.19-9.27). Based on MDS 3.0 assessment, only 11% of PEG feeding tubes were inserted in persons with prior dysphagia. Future research is needed on whether this represents inadequate assessment or the impact of potentially reversible intercurrent illness resulting in feeding tube placement.",

        "AbstractText": "Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a significant and highly prevalent symptom, whose mechanisms are poorly understood. The third Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable paper on PSF focussed primarily on defining and measuring PSF while mechanisms were briefly discussed. This companion paper to the main paper is aimed at elaborating possible mechanisms of PSF. This paper reviews the available evidence that potentially explains the pathophysiology of PSF and draws parallels from fatigue literature in other conditions. We start by proposing a case for phenotyping PSF based on structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of PSF. This is followed by discussion of a potentially significant role of early inflammation in the development of fatigue, specifically the impact of low-grade inflammation and its long-term systemic effects resulting in PSF. Of the many neurotransmitter systems in the brain, the dopaminergic systems have the most evidence for a role in PSF, along with a role in sensorimotor processing. Sensorimotor neural network dynamics are compromised as highlighted by evidence from both neurostimulation and neuromodulation studies. The double-edged sword effect of exercise on PSF provides further insight into how PSF might emerge and the importance of carefully titrating interventional paradigms. The paper concludes by synthesizing the presented evidence into a unifying model of fatigue which distinguishes between factors that pre-dispose, precipitate, and perpetuate PSF. This framework will help guide new research into the biological mechanisms of PSF which is a necessary prerequisite for developing treatments to mitigate the debilitating effects of post-stroke fatigue.",

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 313 adults (age \u2264 20 years). Participants were recruited using non-probability convenience sampling from medical clinics, community centers, and supermarkets located in the Wanhua District of Taipei City. Data were collected with the following self-report questionnaires: a demographic survey, validated instruments for dementia knowledge and attitudes towards dementia (assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire, respectively), and a researcher-developed survey on unfriendly behaviors towards persons with dementia. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis indicated that higher scores for dementia knowledge and more positive attitudes about dementia were significantly associated with lower levels of unfriendly behaviors towards persons living with dementia. Mediation analysis using a robust bootstrap test with 5000 samples indicated that attitudes toward dementia had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between dementia knowledge and unfriendly behaviors. Our findings suggest that increasing public awareness and knowledge about dementia could help the general population develop better attitudes towards dementia, which could subsequently help improve behaviors towards persons living with dementia.",

In recent years, acupuncture has gained recognition as a potential intervention for MCI, attracting significant attention as a promising and well-established therapy. In this study, we critically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of an innovative acupuncture approach, termed \"Kidney Nourishment and Spirit Regulation\", as a therapeutic modality for MCI in geriatric populations. A prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial design where patients will be allocated in acupuncture, placebo (sham acupuncture sessions), or blank for eight weeks. The blank group will receive health education over the same eight-week period and will be offered compensatory acupuncture therapy after this period. The selected acupoints for this investigation include GV20, EX-HN1, GV24, GV29, CV6, CV4, PC6, KI3, LI4, LR3, HT7 and SP6. The primary outcome measure will be the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), while secondary outcomes include the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), and Electroencephalogram (EEG). This study seeks to provide an optimum regimen for acupuncture therapy in elderly MCI patients and to provide considerable theoretical evidence for its popularization and future broad adoption. We thus postulate that the current trial data might enlighten and potentially guide future research in terms of study design refinement.",

We describe a case series of PRES with hemorrhagic features. Subjects and methods Electronic medical records of hospitalized patients diagnosed with PRES from January 2009 to December 2021 were collected. Demographic data, medical history, clinical presentation, and outcome were recorded. Variables were compared between patients with and without hemorrhagic features using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with a statistical significance level of p<0.05. Results Over a 12-year period, 33 patients were diagnosed with PRES, of whom 10 had hemorrhagic features: seven cortical microbleeds, two intraparenchymal hematomas, and one subarachnoid hemorrhage. Half of the patients were women, with a median age of 45.8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21.8), and were admitted for non-neurological reasons. The sample included nine transplant recipients (six solid organa, three bone marrowa), with four patients in the immediate post-transplant period. PRES occurred in the context of infections and blood pressure fluctuations under cytotoxic drugs, such as immunosuppressants. Seventy percent showed improvement/resolution on neuroimaging at a median of 70 days (IQR 62.9). The three major hemorrhages occurred in the context of thrombocytopenia. The recorded in-hospital mortality was 10%. When compared to PRES without hemorrhagic features, patients with hemorrhagic features had a lower use of corticosteroids (50% vs. 78.8%; p=0.02) and a higher presence of restrictive lesions on neuroimaging (60% vs. 17%; p=0.04), with no differences in the other analyzed variables. Conclusion Patients with PRES and hemorrhagic features had a lower use of corticosteroids and a higher presence of restrictive lesions on neuroimaging. Further studies are needed to better understand the clinical implications and management of PRES with hemorrhagic manifestations.",

Pharmacological interventions play a crucial role in managing dementia symptoms and potentially slowing down disease progression. This study aimed to investigate the impact of pharmacological interventions, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), memantine, and Gingko extract, on the progression of dementia, with a specific focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-Alzheimer dementias. A total of 547 participants out of 3,547 cases in a specific dataset followed by the same author, including healthy controls, individuals with MCI, AD, and non-Alzheimer dementias, were included in this study. The follow-up duration was up to 211\u2009months, allowing for a minimum 3 visits comprehensive assessment of disease progression. The treatment approaches included AChEIs, memantine, and combination therapy, with variations in the starting time for these treatments based on the dementia type. The use of AChEIs and memantine showed efficacy in improving cognitive function and overall function in individuals with MCI, AD, and non-AD dementias. Combination therapy EGb761 like Gingko extract with AChEIs and/or Memantine demonstrated a slower progression compared to AChEIs alone in individuals with prodromal dementia (MCI) and AD. The starting time for memantine and combination therapy was earlier in non-AD dementia cases compared to AD dementia cases and prodromal dementia. Pharmacological interventions, particularly the use of AChEIs and memantine, can have a positive impact on cognitive function and overall function in individuals with dementia. The combination of AChEIs with EGb761 like Gingko extract may provide additional benefits in slowing down disease progression in AD cases. Early recognition and accurate classification of MCI subtypes are crucial, and the use of EGb761 like Gingko extract is recommended for symptomatic treatment. Future personalized risk predictions based on biomarker constellations may further enhance the multi-target treatment approaches of MCI and different dementia types.",

        "AbstractText": "Dementia and autoimmune diseases are prevalent conditions with limited treatment options. Taurine and homotaurine (HT) are naturally occurring sulfonate amino acids, with taurine being highly abundant in animal tissues, but declining with age in the blood. HT is a blood-brain barrier permeable drug under investigation for Alzheimer's disease. HT also has beneficial effects in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis likely through an anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by GABAA receptor (GABAAR) agonism in immune cells. While both taurine and HT are structural GABA analogs and thought to be GABA mimetics at GABAARs, there is uncertainty concerning their potency as GABA mimetics on native GABAARs. We show that HT is a very potent GABA mimetic, as it evokes GABAAR-mediated currents with an EC50 of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM (vs. 3.7\u00a0\u03bcM for GABA and 116\u00a0\u00b5M for taurine) in murine cerebellar granule cells in brain slices, with both taurine and HT having similar efficacy in activating native GABAARs. Furthermore, HT displaces the high affinity GABAAR ligand [3H]muscimol at similarly low concentrations (HT IC50 of 0.16\u00a0\u03bcM vs. 125\u00a0\u03bcM for taurine) in mouse brain homogenates. The potency of taurine and HT as GABAAR agonists aligns with endogenous concentrations of taurine in the blood and with HT concentrations achieved in the brain following oral administration of HT or the HT pro-drug ALZ-801. Consequently, we discuss that GABAARs subtypes, similar to the ones we studied here in neurons, are plausible targets for mediating the potential beneficial effects of taurine in health and life-span extension and the beneficial HT effects in dementia and autoimmune conditions.",

This phenomenon is accompanied by a concomitant decline in immune functionality and oral hygiene capacity among the elderly, precipitating compromised oral functionality and an augmented burden of dental plaque. Accordingly, oral afflictions, including dental caries and periodontal disease, manifest with frequency among the geriatric population worldwide. Recent scientific investigations have unveiled the potential role of oral bacteria in instigating both local and systemic chronic inflammation, thereby delineating a putative nexus between oral health and the genesis and progression of AD. They further proposed the oral microbiome as a potentially modifiable risk factor in AD development, although the precise pathological mechanisms and degree of association have yet to be fully elucidated. This review summarizes current research on the relationship between oral bacteria and AD, describing the epidemiological and pathological mechanisms that may potentially link them. The purpose is to enrich early diagnostic approaches by incorporating emerging biomarkers, offering novel insights for clinicians in the early detection of AD. Additionally, it explores the potential of vaccination strategies and guidance for clinical pharmacotherapy. It proposes the development of maintenance measures specifically targeting oral health in older adults and advocates for guiding elderly patients in adopting healthy lifestyle habits, ultimately aiming to indirectly mitigate the progression of AD while promoting oral health in the elderly.",

The relevance of oligomers and protofibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is underscored given their significant neurotoxicity. By closely monitoring the shift of A\u03b242 from its monomeric state to forming oligomeric channels in phospholipid membranes, we noted that this transformation transpired within a 2-h frame. We manipulated the lipid membrane's constitution with components such as glycerophospholipid, porcine brain total lipid extract, sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (Chol.) to effectively imitate nerve cell membranes. Interesting findings showcased Chol.'s ability to foster stable oligomeric channel formation in the lipid membrane, with SM and GM1 lipids potentially enhancing channel formation as well. Additionally, the study identified the potential of a catechin derivative, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), in obstructing oligomerization. With EGCG present in the outer solution of the A\u03b242-infused membrane, a noteworthy reduction in channel current was observed, suggesting the successful inhibition of oligomerization. This conclusion held true in both, prior and subsequent, stages of oligomerization.

However, the clinical benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients still need to be evaluated. This study examined the role of tDCS in improving cognition and whether the improved cognition is related to altered cortical plasticity. 124 patients with AD were randomly assigned to active tDCS (n=63) or sham tDCS (n=61). The tDCS was applied at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 30 treatment sessions across 6 weeks (5\u2009days per week, 2\u2009days off). The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) were used for cognition evaluation at baseline, week 2 and week 6. The cortical plasticity was represented by motor-evoked potential (MEP) measured with an electromyogram. The results showed that multiple courses of active tDCS can improve the cognitive functions of patients with AD, especially in the memory domain (word recall, recall of test instructions and word recognition). In addition, the damaged MEP level was enhanced following active treatment. In the active tDCS group, the improvements in ADAS-Cog total and subitem (word recall and word recognition) scores were negatively correlated with the enhancement of MEP. Our research indicates for the first time that twice-a-day tDCS may improve the cognitive function of patients with AD. This study also suggests that cognitive dysfunction may be related to impaired cortical plasticity, which warrants mechanistic investigations of the relationship between cognition and plasticity in the future.

These design characteristics make it difficult to establish temporal order and draw firm conclusions. Using a longitudinal design, we sought to determine whether childhood maltreatment predicts dementia risk factors in middle adulthood. Data have been obtained from a prospective cohort design study of children with documented cases of childhood maltreatment (ages 0-11 years at case identification) and demographically matched controls who were followed up and interviewed in middle adulthood. Outcomes were assessed through a medical examination and interview, and 807 of the cases that included blood collection at mean age 41. Dementia risk were investigated using 11 potentially modifiable risk factors. Compared to controls, individuals with histories of childhood maltreatment had a higher risk of low educational attainment, low social contact, smoking, and clinical depression, and a higher total number of dementia risk factors. In general, childhood maltreatment predicted a higher risk of dementia for females, males, and Black and White participants. Black maltreated participants had a greater risk for traumatic brain injury compared to Black controls. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect, each predicted a higher number of dementia risk factors in mid-life. These findings provide evidence that childhood maltreatment increases the risk for dementia in mid-life and has a demonstrable impact lasting over 30 years.

Environmental and physical needs were more frequently met than psychological or social needs. Only 48.0% and 43.9% of environmental and physical needs were met respectively, and a meagre 20.9% and 23.6% for psychological and social needs. Unmet care needs were more frequent for PWLD who were female, single or divorced, had lower monthly household income, or who were in more advanced stages of dementia, as indicated by Clinical Dementia Rating scores \u22651. Unmet needs for PWLD are common. Increased caregiver education, resources, and services in Vietnam are urgently required to improve the quality of life for this population.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Mechanism of Intestinal Epithelial Absorption and Electrophysiological Regulation of the Shrimp Peptide QMDDQ.",
        "AbstractText": "We investigated the absorption mechanism of the shrimp peptide QMDDQ in small intestines, explored its physiological function in inhibiting neuronal hyperactivity, and verified its entry into the brain in vivo to display functional activity. The everted rat sac model and a Caco-2 paracellular absorption monolayer model were used, indicating that QMDDQ has a good absorption capacity with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) > 1 \u00d7 10-6 cm/s and the absorption of QMDDQ was concentration-dependent. When the concentration of QMDDQ was 1 mM and the transport time was 180 min, the highest absorption concentration of QMDDQ was 41.17 \u00b1 3.48 \u03bcM (P < 0.05). The myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-specific inhibitor ML-7 and activator MPA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence results showed that QMDDQ absorption takes place by mediating the MLCK-p-MLCK-MLC signaling pathway, reversibly opening the zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin in tight junctions (TJs), upregulating claudin-2 expression, and reaching targets through blood to inhibit neuronal overactivity. Results of fluorescence imaging in vivo verified that QMDDQ could enter the brain 4 h after oral administration. The results provide a theoretical foundation for the mechanism of paracellular absorption of active peptides and a starting point for the development of functional foods for Alzheimer's disease intervention.",

        "AbstractText": "Candidate drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) demonstrate extremely low clinical success rates, with more than 98% of potential treatments being discontinued due to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Neurological conditions were shown to be the second leading cause of death globally in 2016, with the number of people currently affected by neurological disorders increasing rapidly. This increasing trend, along with an inability to develop BBB permeating drugs, is presenting a major hurdle in the treatment of CNS-related disorders, like dementia. To overcome this, it is necessary to understand the structure and function of the BBB, including the transport of molecules across its interface in both healthy and pathological conditions. The use of CNS drug carriers is rapidly gaining popularity in CNS research due to their ability to target BBB transport systems. Further research and development of drug delivery vehicles could provide essential information that can be used to develop novel treatments for neurological conditions. This review discusses the BBB and its transport systems and evaluates the potential of using nanoparticle-based delivery systems as drug carriers for CNS disease with a focus on dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "The protein tau misfolds into disease-specific fibrillar structures in more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. To understand and prevent disease-specific mechanisms of filament formation, in vitro models for aggregation that robustly yield these different end point structures will be necessary. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reconstruct fibril polymorphs taken on by residues 297-391 of tau under conditions previously shown to give rise to the core structure found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While we were able to reconstitute the AD tau core fold, the proportion of these paired helical filaments (PHFs) was highly variable, and a majority of filaments were composed of PHFs with an additional identical C-shaped protofilament attached near the PHF interface, termed triple helical filaments (THFs). Since the impact of filament layer quaternary structure on the biological properties of tau and other amyloid filaments is not known, the applications for samples of this morphology are presently uncertain. We further demonstrate the variation in the proportion of PHFs and PHF-like fibrils compared to other morphologies as a function of shaking time and AD polymorph-favoring cofactor concentration. This variation in polymorph abundance, even under identical experimental conditions, highlights the variation that can arise both within a lab and in different laboratory settings when reconstituting specific fibril polymorphs in vitro.",

        "AbstractText": "Phosphodiesterase 2\u00a0A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a+/- mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a+/- females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of Glutamate receptor (GluR1) in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent Long-term Depression. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD.",

        "AbstractText": "Several observational studies have suggested that oral anticoagulants (OACs) might reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly, but the evidence is inconclusive. And the consistency of this relationship across different OAC classes and dementia subtypes is still uncertain. To comprehensively evaluate this association, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) combined with pharmacovigilance analysis. MR was used to assess the associations between genetic proxies for three target genes of OACs (VKORC1, F2, and F10) and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). This genetic analysis was supplemented with real-world pharmacovigilance data, employing disproportionality analysis for more reliable causal inference. Increased expression of the VKORC1 gene was strongly associated with increased risk of dementia, especially for AD (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.28, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.14-1.43; p value\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Additional sensitivity analyses, including different MR models and cohorts, supported these results. Conversely, no strong causal associations of genetically proxied F2 and F10 target genes with dementia and its subtypes were found. This study reveals that the inhibition of genetically proxied VKORC1 expression or VKAs exposure is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's dementia. However, there is little evidence to support similar associations with direct oral anticoagulants (F2 inhibitors and F10 inhibitors).

AD/ADRD are irreversible mental illnesses that primarily impair memory and thought processes and may lead to cognitive decline among older individuals. The prevalence of AD/ADRD is higher in Native Americans, followed by African Americans and Hispanics. Increasing evidence suggests that Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic population in the USA and worldwide. Hispanics develop clinical symptoms of AD/ADRD and other comorbidities nearly seven years earlier than non-Hispanic whites. The consequences of AD/ADRD can be challenging for patients, their families, and caregivers. There is a significant increase in the burden of illness, primarily affecting Hispanic/Latino families. This is partly due to their strong sense of duty towards family, and it is exacerbated by the inadequacy of healthcare and community services that are culturally and linguistically suitable and responsive to their needs. With an increasing age population, low socioeconomic status, low education, high genetic predisposition to age-related conditions, unique cultural habits, and social behaviors, Hispanic Americans face a higher risk of AD/ADRD than other racial/ethnic groups.

Gene expression profiles were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus database. 222 human BMGs were collected from the relevant literature. Subsequently, the differentially expressed BMGs (DE-BMGs) were filtered, and the key DE-BMGs were identified using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and two machine learning algorithms. The expression levels, diagnostic values, clinical significances, enrichment analyses and regulatory networks of these candidate biomarkers were further examined. A total of 44 DE-BMGs were acquired by comparing AD temporal cortex with nondemented controls. Using WGCNA and machine learning, versiscan (VCAN), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3), and laminin \u03b22 (LAMB2) were ultimately identified as candidate biomarkers, and they were verified in a murine model. These biomarkers had high diagnostic value (area under the curve (AUC)\uff1e0.8). The diagnostic value of the four gene combination was then evaluated in multiple databases, yielding AUCs ranging from 0.688 to 1. Furthermore, a meaningful correlation between these biomarkers and AD pathology progression was observed. Finally, comprehensive analyses involving Hallmark pathway enrichment, immune cell infiltration analysis, transcriptional regulatory, and competitive endogenous RNA networks indicated that key DE-BMGs closely correlated with oxidative stress and immune dysfunction.

We convened a multi-stakeholder working group including a patient, caregivers, Alzheimer's Association staff, and clinicians from diverse backgrounds. The panel used the American Academy of Neurology process for recommendation development, consisting of a half-day workshop and 3 rounds of anonymous modified Delphi voting to achieve consensus. The working group convened from May 2022 through January 2023. The group chose to focus statements on a limited number of best practices that can be applied across clinic types. Seven best practice statements achieved consensus after a maximum of 3 rounds of voting. These included the following: (1) Clinicians must show compassion and empathy when delivering a diagnosis of dementia (level A). During dementia diagnosis disclosure, clinicians should (2) ask regarding diagnosis preferences, (3) instill realistic hope, (4) provide practical strategies, (5) provide education and connections to high-quality resources, (6) connect caregivers to support resources, and (7) provide written summaries of the diagnoses, plan, and relevant resources (each level B). Clinicians need to customize discussion of a dementia diagnosis for individual patients and their caregivers. These 7 best practices provide a diagnosis communication framework that can be implemented across varied clinical settings. Additional strategies, such as using optimal general communication approaches, are also important for dementia diagnosis discussions. Thoughtful application of these best practices is particularly important when caring for individuals from underrepresented communities. Further improving communication regarding dementia diagnoses will require health system changes (e.g., for sufficient time), improved access to specialty dementia care, and clinician training for delivering difficult diagnoses.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment, with the predominant clinical diagnosis of spatial working memory (SWM) deficiency, which seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients. However, the current pharmacological therapies have unsatisfactory cure rates and other problems, so non-pharmacological physical therapies have gradually received widespread attention. Recently, a novel treatment using 40 Hz light flicker stimulation (40 Hz-LFS) to rescue the cognitive function of model animals with AD has made initial progress, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this paper will explore the potential neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of SWM by 40 Hz-LFS based on cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Ten adult Wistar rats were first subjected to acute LFS at frequencies of 20, 40, and 60 Hz. The entrainment effect of LFS with different frequency on neural oscillations in the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was analyzed. The results showed that acute 40 Hz-LFS was able to develop strong entrainment and significantly modulate the oscillation power of the low-frequency gamma (l\u03b3) rhythms. The rats were then randomly divided into experimental and control groups of 5 rats each for a long-term 40 Hz-LFS (7 d). Their SWM function was assessed by a T-maze task, and the CFC changes in the HPC-mPFC circuit were analyzed by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The results showed that the behavioral performance of the experimental group was improved and the PAC of \u03b8-l\u03b3 rhythm was enhanced, and the difference was statistically significant. The results of this paper suggested that the long-term 40 Hz-LFS effectively improved SWM function in rats, which may be attributed to its enhanced communication of different rhythmic oscillations in the relevant neural circuits. It is expected that the study in this paper will build a foundation for further research on the mechanism of 40 Hz-LFS to improve cognitive function and promote its clinical application in the future. \u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\uff08AD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SWM\uff09\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u836f\u7269\u7597\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6cbb\u6108\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u975e\u836f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u7597\u6cd5\u9010\u6e10\u53d7\u5230\u4eba\u4eec\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc740 Hz\u5149\u95ea\u70c1\u523a\u6fc0\uff0840 Hz-LFS\uff09\u6539\u5584AD\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u7269SWM\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u53d6\u5f97\u521d\u6b65\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5177\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u9891\u7387\u8026\u5408\uff08CFC\uff09\u63a2\u7a7640 Hz-LFS\u8c03\u63a7SWM\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ee510\u53ea\u6210\u5e74\u7ef4\u65af\u5854\u5c14\uff08Wistar\uff09\u5927\u9f20\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5e94\u752820\u300140\u300160 Hz\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u95ea\u70c1\u523a\u6fc0\uff08LFS\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387LFS\u5bf9\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\uff08HPC\uff09\u548c\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u5c42\uff08mPFC\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5939\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c40 Hz-LFS\u80fd\u591f\u5f62\u6210\u5939\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8c03\u63a7\u4f4e\u9891\u03b3\uff08l\u03b3\uff09\u8282\u5f8b\u632f\u8361\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u5927\u9f20\u5206\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec45\u53ea\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c40 Hz-LFS\u957f\u671f\u4f5c\u7528\uff087 d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7T\u8ff7\u5bab\u4efb\u52a1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5176SWM\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u4f4d\u5e45\u503c\u8026\u5408\uff08PAC\uff09\u5206\u6790HPC\u4e0emPFC\u95f4\uff08HPC-mPFC\uff09\u56de\u8def\u7684CFC\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u03b8\u8282\u5f8b\u548cl\u03b3\uff08\u03b8-l\u03b3\uff09\u7684PAC\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u957f\u671f40 Hz-LFS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5927\u9f20\u7684SWM\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u7684\u8de8\u8282\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002\u671f\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u4eca\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a7640 Hz-LFS\u6539\u5584\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002.",

        "AbstractText": "A healthy daily diet and consuming certain nutrients, such as polyphenols, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids, may help neuronal health maintenance. Polyphenolic chemicals, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, are involved in the neuroprotective pathway. Because of their nutritional value, nuts have been shown in recent research to be helpful in neuroprotection. Hazelnut is often consumed worldwide in various items, including processed foods, particularly in bakery, chocolate, and confectionery products. This nut is an excellent source of vitamins, amino acids, tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols, minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids. Consuming hazelnut may attenuate the risk of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant qualities. Many documents introduce hazelnut as an excellent choice to provide neuroprotection against neurodegenerative disorders and there is some direct proof of its neuroprotective effects. So hazelnut consumption in daily diet may reduce neurodegenerative disease risk and be advantageous in reducing the imposed costs of dealing with neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multi-Domain Interventions for Dementia Prevention - A Systematic Review.",
        "AbstractText": "There is a growing incidence of cognitive decline and dementia associated with the ageing population. Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and cognitive activities may individually or collectively be undertaken to increase one's odds of preventing cognitive decline and future dementia. This study will examine whether clinical trials using multidomain lifestyle intervention can significantly decrease the risk of cognitive decline and therefore dementia. This systematic literature review of multidomain lifestyle interventions for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia followed the PRISMA guidelines. Clinical trials involving multidomain intervention (i.e., diet and physical activity, or without cognitive training) in older adults (\u2265 49 years old) at higher risk of dementia were identified through 5 electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Scopus). A comprehensive search was performed to identify and retrieve publications until 15 November 2022. Trials were published in English. The included studies (n=15) assessed change in cognition in response to a multidomain lifestyle intervention. However, the cognitive outcome measures used in these studies were heterogeneous. Despite this heterogeneity, two thirds of the studies showed improvement in cognition following a multidomain intervention (n=10 with a total of 9,439 participants). However, five studies reported no improvement in cognition following the multidomain intervention. The most common form of dietary intervention included higher amount of fruit and vegetable intake; whole-grain cereal products instead of refined; low fat options in milk and meat products; and limiting sucrose intake to less than 50 g/day. Most clinical trial studies were powered to examining the effects of multidomain interventions in cognition but were not designed to test the contribution of individual domains (i.e., dietary changes, increased physical activity, or increased cognitive stimulation alone). This systematic review aimed to determine the effect of multimodal lifestyle interventions on cognitive outcomes in older adults at risk of dementia. We found that participants with conditions that may increase the risk of dementia, (e.g., hypertension, cardiovascular fragility) do benefit from multi-modal lifestyle changes including diet, physical activity, and cognitive training. Two thirds of studies using multidomain lifestyle interventions showed improvements in cognitive function. Trials with a focus on cognitive training, dietary improvement, and physical activity may prevent or delay cognitive decline in older adults including those at risk of developing dementia. Future studies should consider longer follow-up periods and adequate power to be able to examine the effects of each lifestyle component in the context of multimodal interventions.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Dietary Tyrosine Intake (FFQ) Is Associated with Locus Coeruleus, Attention and Grey Matter Maintenance: An MRI Structural Study on 398 Healthy Individuals of the Berlin Aging Study-II.",
        "AbstractText": "It is documented that low protein and amino-acid dietary intake is related to poorer cognitive health and increased risk of dementia. Degradation of the neuromodulatory pathways, (comprising the cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems) is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and impairs the proper biosynthesis of key neuromodulators from micro-nutrients and amino acids. How these micro-nutrients are linked to neuromodulatory pathways in healthy adults is less studied. The Locus Coeruleus-Noradrenergic System (LC-NA) is the earliest subcortical structure affected in Alzheimer's disease, showing marked neurodegeneration, but is also sensitive for age-related changes. The LC-NA system is critical for supporting attention and cognitive control, functions that are enhanced both by tyrosine administration and chronic tyrosine intake. The purpose of this study was to 1) investigate whether the dietary intake of tyrosine, the key precursor for noradrenaline (NA), is related to LC signal intensity 2) whether LC mediates the reported association between tyrosine intake and higher cognitive performance (measured with Trail Making Test - TMT), and 3) whether LC signal intensity relates to an objective measure of brain maintenance (BrainPAD). The analyses included 398 3T MRIs of healthy participants from the Berlin Aging Study II to investigate the relationship between LC signal intensity and habitual dietary tyrosine intake-daily average (HD-Tyr-IDA - measured with Food Frequency Questionnaire - FFQ). As a control procedure, the same analyses were repeated on other main seeds of the neuromodulators' subcortical system (Dorsal and Medial Raphe, Ventral Tegmental Area and Nucleus Basalis of Meynert). In the same way, the relationships between the five nuclei and BrainPAD were tested. Results show that HD-Tyr-IDA is positively associated with LC signal intensity. Similarly, LC disproportionally relates to better brain maintenance (BrainPAD). Mediation analyses reveal that only LC, relative to the other nuclei tested, mediates the relationship between HD-Tyr-IDA I and performance in the TMT and between HD-Tyr-IDA and BrainPAD. These findings provide the first evidence linking tyrosine intake with LC-NA system signal intensity and its correlation with neuropsychological performance. This study strengthens the role of diet for maintaining brain and cognitive health and supports the noradrenergic theory of cognitive reserve. Within this framework, adequate tyrosine intake might increase the resilience of LC-NA system functioning, by preventing degeneration and supporting noradrenergic metabolism required for LC function and neuropsychological performance.",

        "AbstractText": "Real-world monitoring using wearable sensors has enormous potential for assessing disease severity and symptoms among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many distinct features can be extracted, reflecting multiple mobility domains. However, it is unclear which digital measures are related to PD severity and are sensitive to disease progression. The aim was to identify real-world mobility measures that reflect PD severity and show discriminant ability and sensitivity to disease progression, compared to the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scale. Multicenter real-world continuous (24/7) digital mobility data from 587 persons with PD and 68 matched healthy controls were collected using an accelerometer adhered to the lower back. Machine learning feature selection and regression algorithms evaluated associations of the digital measures using the MDS-UPDRS (I-III). Binary logistic regression assessed discriminatory value using controls, and longitudinal observational data from a subgroup (n\u2009=\u200933) evaluated sensitivity to change over time. Digital measures were only moderately correlated with the MDS-UPDRS (part II-r\u2009=\u20090.60 and parts I and III-r\u2009=\u20090.50). Most associated measures reflected activity quantity and distribution patterns. A model with 14 digital measures accurately distinguished recently diagnosed persons with PD from healthy controls (81.1%, area under the curve: 0.87); digital measures showed larger effect sizes (Cohen's d: [0.19-0.66]), for change over time than any of the MDS-UPDRS parts (Cohen's d: [0.04-0.12]). Real-world mobility measures are moderately associated with clinical assessments, suggesting that they capture different aspects of motor capacity and function. Digital mobility measures are sensitive to early-stage disease and to disease progression, to a larger degree than conventional clinical assessments, demonstrating their utility, primarily for clinical trials but ultimately also for clinical care. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Before implementation in routine clinical practice, confounding factors modifying their concentration beyond neurodegenerative diseases should be identified. We studied the association of a comprehensive list of demographics, comorbidities, medication and laboratory parameters with plasma p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) on a prospective memory clinic cohort and studied their impact on diagnostic accuracy for discriminating CSF/amyloid PET-defined A\u03b2 status. Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5\u00a0years, 55% females, 53% A\u03b2 positive) were included. Sex, age and A\u03b2 status-adjusted models showed that only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, standardized \u03b2 -0.115 [-0.192 to -0.035], p\u2009=\u20090.005) was associated with p-tau181 levels, although with a much smaller effect than A\u03b2 status (0.685 [0.607-0.763], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and eGFR significantly modified GFAP concentration. Age, blood volume (BV) and eGFR were associated with NfL levels. p-tau181 predicted A\u03b2 status with 87% sensitivity and specificity with no relevant increase in diagnostic performance by adding any of the confounding factors. Using two cut-offs, plasma p-tau181 could have spared 62% of amyloid-PET/CSF testing. Excluding patients with chronic kidney disease did not change the proposed cut-offs nor the diagnostic performance. In conclusion, in a memory clinic cohort, age, sex, eGFR, BMI, BV and CCI slightly modified plasma p-tau181, GFAP and NfL concentrations but their impact on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma biomarkers for A\u03b2 status discrimination was minimal.",

        "AbstractText": "iRhom2 is a crucial cofactor involved in upregulation of TNF receptors (TNFRs) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) from the cell surface by ADAM17. Tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE) is another name given to ADAM17. Many membrane attached biologically active molecules are cleaved by this enzyme which includes TNFRs and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1. The TNF receptors are of two types TNFR1 and TNFR2. iRhom2 belongs to the pseudo-protease class of rhomboid family, its abundance is observed in the immune cells. Biological activity of ADAM17 is affected in multiple levels by the iRhom2. ADAM17 is trafficked into the Golgi apparatus by the action of iRhom2, where it gets matured proteolytically and is stimulated to perform its function on the cell surface. This process of activation of ADAM17 results in the protection of the organism from the cascade of inflammatory reactions, as this activation blocks the TNF- \u03b1 mediated secretion responsible for inflammatory responses produced. Present paper illustrates about the iRhom2-TNF-\u03b1-BAFF signaling pathway and its correlation with several autoimmune disorders such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Hemophilia Arthropathy, Alzheimer's disease and Tylosis with esophageal cancer etc.",

Therefore, a better understanding of key protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for effective prevention and treatment of those disorders. The proteasome expression is tightly regulated by a CNC (cap'n'collar) family of transcription factors, amongst which the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like bZIP factor 1 (NFE2L1, also known as Nrf1, with its long isoform TCF11 and short isoform LCR-F1) has been identified as an indispensable regulator of the transcriptional expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, much less is known about how the pivotal role of NFE2L1/Nrf1, as compared to its homologous NFE2L2 (also called Nrf2), is translated to its physiological and pathophysiological functions in the nervous system insomuch as to yield its proper cytoprotective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. The potential of NFE2L1 to fulfill its unique neuronal function to serve as a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases is explored by evaluating the hitherto established preclinical and clinical studies of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this review, we have also showcased a group of currently available activators of NFE2L1, along with an additional putative requirement of this CNC-bZIP factor for healthy longevity based on the experimental evidence obtained from its orthologous SKN1-A in Caenorhabditis elegans.",

        "AbstractText": "Since Alzheimer disease is one of the most prevalent types of dementia with a high mortality and disability rate, so development of multi-target drugs becomes the major strategy for battling AD. This study shows the development of a series of quinazolinone based derivatives as novel, multifunctional anti-AD drugs that exhibit both cholinesterase inhibitoryand anti-inflammatory properties. The preliminary results of the in vitro AChE inhibition activity showed that compounds 4b, 5a, 6f, 6h and 7b were better represented for further evaluation. Furthermore, in-vivo AChE inhibition activity and behavior Morris water maze test against donepezil as reference drug were evaluated. Additionally, hippocampal inflammatory markers; TNF-\u03b1, NF\u0138B, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and antioxidant markers; SOD and MDA were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of quinazolinone derivatives against AD hallmarks. The results showed that 6f, 6h and 7b have promising anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities thus, have a significant effect in treatment of AD. Moreover, Histopathological examination revealed that 6f, 6h and 7b derivatives have neuroprotective effect against neuronal damage caused by induced scopolamine model in mice. Finally, the binding ability of the synthesized derivatives to the target, AChE was investigated through molecular docking which reflected significant interactions to the target based on their docking binding scores. Hence, the newly designed quinazolinone derivatives possess promising anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and challenging for the management of AD in the future.",

Stroke has still been a significant challenge in clinics for a long time, which is the second leading cause of death in the world, especially ischemic stroke. Both Alzheimer's disease and stroke are closely related to oxidative stress and HIF-1 signaling pathways in nerve cells.

        "AbstractText": "SCA27B caused by FGF14 intronic heterozygous GAA expansions with at least 250 repeats accounts for 10-60% of cases with unresolved cerebellar ataxia. We aimed to assess the size and frequency of FGF14 expanded alleles in individuals with cerebellar ataxia as compared with controls and to characterize genetic and clinical variability. We sized this repeat in 1876 individuals from France sampled for research purposes in this cross-sectional study: 845 index cases with cerebellar ataxia and 324 affected relatives, 475 controls, as well as 119 cases with spastic paraplegia, and 113 with familial essential tremor. A higher frequency of expanded allele carriers in index cases with ataxia was significant only above 300 GAA repeats (10.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a085) compared with controls (1.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a05) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) whereas GAA250-299 alleles were detected in 1.7% of both groups. Eight of 14 index cases with GAA250-299 repeats had other causal pathogenic variants (4/14) and/or discordance of co-segregation (5/14), arguing against GAA causality. We compared the clinical signs in 127 GAA\u2265300 carriers to cases with non-expanded GAA ataxia resulting in defining a key phenotype triad: onset after 45 years, downbeat nystagmus, episodic ataxic features including diplopia; and a frequent absence of dysarthria. All maternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA were unstable with a median expansion of\u00a0+18 repeats per generation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.44; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In comparison, paternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA mostly decreased in size (-15 GAA (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.63; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)), resulting in the transmission bias observed in SCA27B pedigrees. SCA27B diagnosis must consider both the phenotype and GAA expansion size. In carriers of GAA250-299 repeats, the absence of documented familial transmission and a presentation deviating from the key SCA27B phenotype, should prompt the search for an alternative cause. Affected fathers have a reduced risk of having affected children, which has potential implications for genetic counseling.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a well-established tool used to detect \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain. Previous studies have shown that cross-sectional biomarkers can predict cognitive decline (Schindler et al.,2021). However, it is still unclear whether longitudinal A\u03b2-PET may have additional value for predicting time to cognitive impairment in AD. The current study aims to evaluate the ability of baseline- versus longitudinal rate of change in-11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) A\u03b2-PET to predict cognitive decline. A cohort of 153 participants who previously underwent PiB-PET scans and comprehensive clinical assessments were used in this study. Our analyses revealed that baseline A\u03b2 is significantly associated with the rate of change in cognitive composite scores, with cognition declining more rapidly when baseline PiB A\u03b2 levels were higher. In contrast, no signification association was identified between the rate of change in PiB-PET A\u03b2 and cognitive decline. Additionally, the ability of the rate of change in the PiB-PET measures to predict cognitive decline was significantly influenced by APOE \u03b54 carrier status. These results suggest that a single PiB-PET scan is sufficient to predict cognitive decline and that longitudinal measures of A\u03b2 accumulation do not improve the prediction of cognitive decline once someone is amyloid positive.",

Here, we evaluate the relationship between neighborhood perceptions and amygdala activity and connectivity with salience network (i.e., insula, anterior cingulate, thalamus) nodes. Forty-eight older adults (mean age = 68 [7] years, 52% female, 47% non-Hispanic Black, 2% Hispanic) without dementia or depression completed the Perceptions of Neighborhood Environment Scale. Lower scores indicated less favorable perceptions of aesthetic quality, walking environment, availability of healthy food, safety, violence (i.e., more perceived violence), social cohesion, and participation in activities with neighbors. Participants separately underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Less favorable perceived safety ( \u03b2 = -0.33, pFDR = .04) and participation in activities with neighbors ( \u03b2 = -0.35, pFDR = .02) were associated with higher left amygdala activity, independent of covariates including psychosocial factors. Less favorable safety perceptions were also associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral insular cortices and the left anterior insula ( \u03b2 = -0.34, pFDR = .04). Less favorable perceived social cohesion was associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the right thalamus ( \u03b2 = -0.42, pFDR = .04), and less favorable perceptions about healthy food availability were associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral anterior insula (right: \u03b2 = -0.39, pFDR = .04; left: \u03b2 = -0.42, pFDR = .02) and anterior cingulate gyrus ( \u03b2 = -0.37, pFDR = .04).

However, many CCC devices do not provide the necessary capacity for identifying novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs in a drug discovery context. Here, we present a high-capacity cell culture microtiter microfluidic plate compliant with American National Standard Institute of the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (ANSI/SLAS) standards that allows to parallelize up to 96 CCCs/experimental units, where each experimental unit comprises three microchannel-connected compartments. The plate design allows the specific treatment of cells in individual compartments through the application of a fluidic barrier. Moreover, the compatibility of the plate with neuronal cultures was confirmed with rodent primary as well as human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons of the central or peripheral nervous system for up to 14 days in culture. Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated that the plate design restricts neuronal soma to individual compartments, while axons, but not dendrites, can grow through the connecting microchannels to neighboring compartments. In addition, we show that neurons are spontaneously active and, as deemed by the appearance of synchronous depolarizations in neighboring compartments, are synaptically coupled. In summary, the design of the microfluidic plate allows for both morphological and functional studies of neurological in vitro cultures with increased capacity to support identification of novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs.",

Prior sociological research has uncovered nuanced perspectives of a good death, yet there has been minimal exploration into how marginalised communities reconstruct their own ideals of a good death in response to structural and institutional inequities. Utilising data from 47 in-depth interviews, I examine how transgender older adults perceive and plan for ageing and end-of-life experiences through advance care planning. My analysis reveals transgender older adults' reevaluated notions of a normatively desirable good death for themselves due to existing inequities. Consequently, they actively reconstruct a personalised ideology of death that is adequate enough to meet their end-of-life needs. I further offer the conceptualisation of SATISFICING DEATH, as a process of individuals from marginalised communities reevaluating and reconstructing their own ideologies of a good death that is adequate enough while using resourceful strategies to improve existing social conditions for themselves. These findings highlight the critical need to provide affirming end-of-life care, support, and resources to transgender communities.",

We report herein new quinolinone hybrids as dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and A\u03b2 aggregation that function as multitargeted ligands for Alzheimer's disease. The quinoline hybrids (AM1-AM16) were screened for their ability to inhibit AChE, BACE1, amyloid fibrillation, \u03b1-syn aggregation, and tau aggregation. Among the tested compounds, AM5 and AM10 inhibited AChE activity by more than 80% at single-dose screening and possessed a remarkable ability to inhibit the fibrillation of A\u03b242 oligomers at 10 \u03bcM. In addition, dose-dependent screening of AM5 and AM10 was performed, giving half-maximal AChE inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.29 \u00b1 0.13 and 1.72 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, AM5 and AM10 demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibitory profiles for the aggregation of A\u03b242 oligomers with estimated IC50 values of 4.93 \u00b1 0.8 and 1.42 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, the neuroprotective properties of the lead compounds AM5 and AM10 were determined in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with A\u03b2 oligomers. This work would enable future research efforts aiming at the structural optimization of AM5 and AM10 to develop potent dual inhibitors of AChE and amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, the in vivo assay confirmed the antioxidant activity of compounds AM5 and AM10 through increasing GSH, CAT, and SOD activities that are responsible for scavenging the ROS and restoring its normal level. Blood investigation illustrated the protective activity of the two compounds against lead-induced neurotoxicity through retaining hematological and liver enzymes near normal levels.

At the same time, 18F-AV-45 PET/computed tomography (CT) brain scanning was performed in 15 patients with dementia to determine whether AD was the cause of the dementia. After optimizing the parameters, it was discovered that the highest synthesis efficiency was achieved with a AV-105 dosage of 2mg, a reaction temperature of 130oC, and 1mL of DMSO.

Family caregivers were involved in interventions aimed at planning care, life review (eg, documentation of life experiences of their relative), and selecting activities for their relative. Family caregivers preferred an active role in developing optimal care for their relative. Drivers of success and barriers to family involvement centred around three themes: (1) communication between all involved; (2) prerequisites (organisational and other conditions) and (3) personal circumstances (family's coping and skills). Best practices for involving family caregivers in interventions aimed at addressing responsive behaviour in residents with dementia concerned those interventions in which family caregivers were given an important role in managing responsive behaviour.

        "AbstractText": "Nearly 300,000 older adults experience a hip fracture every year, the majority of which occur following a fall. Unfortunately, recovery after fall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long time in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative recuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and spending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization, identifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is imperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the characteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as contributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to help overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured confounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death. This article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to simultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in health services research, especially when using large administrative claims databases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light computation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic properties with stabilized inference assisted by unsupervised clustering.

Recent studies have highlighted the differences in the reliability of GFAP measurements in different biological matrices. The reason for these discrepancies is poorly understood as our knowledge of the protein's 3-dimensional conformation, proteoforms, and aggregation remains limited. Here, we investigate the structural properties of GFAP under different conditions. For this, we characterized recombinant GFAP proteins from various suppliers and applied hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of GFAP in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) compared to the phosphate buffer. Our findings indicate that recombinant GFAP exists in various conformational species. Furthermore, we show that GFAP dimers remained intact under denaturing conditions. HDX-MS experiments show an overall decrease in H-bonding and an increase in solvent accessibility of GFAP in aCSF compared to the phosphate buffer, with clear indications of mixed EX2 and EX1 kinetics. To understand possible structural interface regions and the evolutionary conservation profiles, we combined HDX-MS results with the predicted GFAP-dimer structure by AlphaFold-Multimer. We found that deprotected regions with high structural flexibility in aCSF overlap with predicted conserved dimeric 1B and 2B domain interfaces. Structural property predictions combined with the HDX data show an overall deprotection and signatures of aggregation in aCSF. We anticipate that the outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural flexibility of GFAP and ultimately shed light on its behavior in different biological matrices.",

However, evidence is still sparce regarding the atrophy of hippocampus and hippocampal subfields in normal aging adults who later developed MCI or AD. To examine whether atrophy of hippocampus and hippocampal subfields has occurred in normal aging before a diagnosis of MCI or AD. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of cognitively normal (CN, n\u2009=\u2009144), MCI (n\u2009=\u200990), and AD (n\u2009=\u2009145) participants obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The CN participants were categorized into early dementia converters (CN-C) and non-converters (CN-NC) based on their scores of clinical dementia rating after an average of 36.2\u2009months (range: 6-105\u2009months). We extracted the whole hippocampus and hippocampal subfields for each participant using FreeSurfer, and analyzed the differences in volumes of hippocampus and hippocampal subfields between groups. We then examined the associations between volume of hippocampal subfields and delayed recall scores in each group separately. Hippocampus and most of the hippocampal subfields demonstrated significant atrophy during the progression of AD. The CN-C and CN-NC groups differed in the left hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA). Furthermore, the volume of presubiculum was significantly correlated with delayed recall scores in the CN-NC and AD groups, but not in the CN-C and MCI groups. Hippocampal subfield atrophy (i.e., left HATA) had occurred in cognitively normal elderly individuals before clinical symptoms were recognized. Significant associations of presubiculum with delayed recall scores in the CN-NC and AD groups highlight the essential role of the hippocampal subfields in both early dementia detection and AD progression.",

We injected 17 macaques in the entorhinal cortex with nanograms of seeding-competent tau aggregates purified from AD brains or control extracts from aged-matched healthy brains, with or without intracerebroventricular co-injections of oligomeric-A\u03b2. Pathological tau injection increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181 concentration after 18 months. Tau pathology spreads from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal trisynaptic loop and the cingulate cortex, resuming the experimental progression of Braak stage I to IV. Many AD-related molecular networks were impacted by tau seeds injections regardless of A\u03b2 injections in proteomic analyses. However, we found mature neurofibrillary tangles, increased CSF total-tau concentration, and pre- and postsynaptic degeneration only in A\u03b2 co-injected macaques. Oligomeric-A\u03b2 mediates the maturation of tau pathology and its neuronal toxicity in macaques but not its initial spreading.

Recent studies have shown that these biomolecular condensates can play both promoting and inhibitory roles in fibrillar protein self-assembly, a process that is linked to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and various prion diseases. Yet, the exact regulatory role of these condensates in protein aggregation remains unknown. By employing microfluidics to create artificial protein compartments, the self-assembly behavior of the fibrillar protein lysozyme within them can be characterized. It is observed that the volumetric parameters of protein-rich compartments can change the kinetics of protein self-assembly. Depending on the change in compartment parameters, the lysozyme fibrillation process either accelerated or decelerated. Furthermore, the results confirm that the volumetric parameters govern not only the nucleation and growth phases of the fibrillar aggregates but also affect the crosstalk between the protein-rich and protein-poor phases. The appearance of phase-separated compartments in the vicinity of natively folded protein complexes triggers their abrupt percolation into the compartments' core and further accelerates protein aggregation. Overall, the results of the study shed more light on the complex behavior and functions of protein-rich phases and, importantly, on their interaction with the surrounding environment.",

We utilized FDG PET to evaluate which brain regions are most susceptible to altered glucose metabolism after chemoradiation in patients with head and neck cancer (HNCa). Real-world FDG PET images were acquired as standard of care before and after chemoradiation for HNCa in 68 patients. Linear mixed-effects voxelwise models assessed changes after chemoradiation in cerebral glucose metabolism quantified with standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), covarying for follow-up time and patient demographics. Voxelwise analysis revealed two large clusters of decreased glucose metabolism in the medial frontal and polar temporal cortices following chemoradiation, with decreases of approximately 5% SUVR after therapy. These findings provide evidence that standard chemoradiation for HNCa can lead to decreased neuronal glucose metabolism, contributing to literature emphasizing the vulnerability of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, especially in HNCa, where these areas may be particularly vulnerable to indirect radiation-induced injury.

Despite the evidence supporting the association between tau proteins and brain atrophy, further studies are needed to explore their link to neuronal dysfunction in the human brain. To clarify the relationship between neuronal dysfunction and abnormal proteins in AD-affected brains, we conducted magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and assessed the neurofilament light chain plasma levels (NfL). We evaluated tau and amyloid-\u03b2 depositions using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of florzolotau (18F) for tau and 11C-PiB for amyloid-\u03b2 positron emission tomography in the same patients. Heatmaps were generated to visualize Z scores of glutamate to creatine (Glu/Cr) and N-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios using data from healthy controls. In AD brains, Z score maps revealed reduced Glu/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios in the gray matter, particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Glu/Cr ratios were negatively correlated with florzolotau (18F) SUVRs in the PCC, and plasma NfL levels were elevated and negatively correlated with Glu/Cr (P\u00a0=\u00a00.040, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.50) and NAA/Cr ratios (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.68) in the rDLPFC. This suggests that the abnormal tau proteins in AD-affected brains play a role in diminishing glutamate levels. Furthermore, neuronal dysfunction markers including Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr could potentially indicate favorable clinical outcomes. Using MRSI provided spatial information about neural dysfunction in AD, enabling the identification of vulnerabilities in the rDLPFC and PCC within the AD's pathological context.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Stress-granules, P-bodies, and cell aging: A bioinformatics study.",
        "AbstractText": "At the molecular level, aging is often accompanied by dysfunction of stress-induced membrane-less organelles (MLOs) and changes in their physical state (or material properties). In this work, we analyzed the proteins included in the proteome of stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies for their tendency to transform the physical state of these MLOs. Particular attention was paid to the proteins whose gene expression changes during replicative aging. It was shown that the proteome of the studied MLOs consists of intrinsically disordered proteins, 30-40% of which are potentially capable of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Proteins whose gene expression changes during the transition of human cells to a senescent state make up about 20% of the studied proteomes. There is a statistically significant increase in the number of positively charged proteins in both datasets studied compared to the complete proteomes of these organelles. An increase in the relative content of DNA-, but not RNA-binding proteins, was also found in the SG dataset with senescence-related processes. Among SGs proteins potentially involved in senescent processes, there is an increase in the abundance of potentially amyloidogenic proteins compared to the whole proteome. Proteins common to SGs and P-bodies, potentially involved in processes associated with senescence, form clusters of interacting proteins. The largest cluster is represented by RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA processing and translation regulation. These data indicate that SG proteins, but not proteins of P-bodies, are more likely to transform the physical state of MLOs. Furthermore, these MLOs can participate in processes associated with aging in a coordinated manner.",

        "AbstractText": "Early risk stratification for clinical dementia could lead to preventive therapies. We identified and validated a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signature for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ARDR). An MRI ADRD signature was derived from cortical thickness maps in Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants with AD dementia and matched controls. The signature was related to the risk of ADRD and cognitive function in FHS. Results were replicated in the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UCD-ADRC) cohort. Participants in the bottom quartile of the signature had more than three times increased risk for ADRD compared to those in the upper three quartiles (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Greater thickness in the signature was related to better general cognition (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and episodic memory (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Results replicated in UCD-ADRC. We identified a robust neuroimaging biomarker for persons at increased risk of ADRD. Other cohorts will further test the validity of this biomarker.",

        "AbstractText": "The primary purpose of this study was to explore the needs and challenges of African American family caregivers of People living with dementia (PLWD) from the perspective of service providers including healthcare and social service providers. The study conducted three online semi-structured focus group interviews with service providers (n\u2009=\u200915). Data were analyzed using Braun & Clarke's guide to thematic analysis approach. Five themes emerged from the analysis of the focus group data: (i) Inadequate information about resources; (ii) Dementia education; (iii) Burden of dementia on families; (iv) Limited financial support and funding; and (v) Suggestions for needed resources. Service providers expressed the lack of community-based dementia service and support programs in African American communities. Findings from the study indicated the need to provide culturally appropriate information on dementia caregiving. This study adds to the scope of knowledge by exploring the processes of seeking help and using services.",

        "AbstractText": "To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and compliance to therapy with Mioreol, first used as part of routine clinical practice in patients with moderate-to-severe dementia due to AD. The study was conducted as a non-interventional observational program. The work was performed on a group of 48 patients with moderate-to-severe AD aged from 60 to 90 years (median age 74 [69; 77]). The therapeutic dose of Mioreol was 10 mg donepezil + 20 mg memantine, the drug was taken orally, once a day at the same time, regardless of meals. The duration of the course of therapy was 24 weeks. The effects of the drug were assessed using the MMSE, ADAS-Cog, NPI, and CGI scales before the start of therapy and by the end of 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The use of Mioreol in six-month therapy of AD patients with moderate-to-severe dementia improved not only cognitive but also a wide range of non-cognitive mental disorders. There was an improvement in the CGI-C scale in more than 50% of included patients, positive dynamics on the ADAS-cog scale (6.5 points reduction in total score) and reduction of non-cognitive mental disorders on the NPI scale (4 points reduction in total score). Fixed-dose combination therapy with Mioreol is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. A combination of fixed-dose therapeutic doses of donepezil and memantine is potentially more appropriate than the simultaneous use of two recommended drugs for the treatment of AD, which will improve treatment adherence in patients with moderate to severe AD. \u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438,

        "AbstractText": "Hyperpolarization techniques significantly enhance the sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) and thus present fascinating new directions for research and applications with in vivo MR imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S). Hyperpolarized 13C MRI/S, in particular, enables real-time non-invasive assessment of metabolic processes and holds great promise for a diverse range of clinical applications spanning fields like oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with a potential for improving early diagnosis of disease, patient stratification, and therapy response assessment. Despite its potential, technical challenges remain for achieving clinical translation. This paper provides an overview of the discussions that took place at the international workshop \"New Horizons in Hyperpolarized 13C MRI,\" in March 2023 at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich, Germany. The workshop covered new developments, as well as future directions, in topics including polarization techniques (particularly focusing on parahydrogen-based methods), novel probes, considerations related to data acquisition and analysis, and emerging clinical applications in oncology and other fields.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Fangchinoline alleviates cognitive impairments through enhancing autophagy and mitigating oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease models.",
        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and subsequent oxidative stress, resulting in a cascade of cytotoxic effects. Fangchinoline (Fan), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from traditional Chinese herb Stephania tetrandra S. Moorec, has been reported to possess multiple potent biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the potential neuroprotective efficacy of Fan against AD remains unknown. Methods: N2AAPP cells, the mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells stably transfected with human Swedish mutant APP695, were served as an in vitro AD model. A mouse model of AD was constructed by microinjection of A\u03b21-42 peptides into lateral ventricle of WT mice. The neuroprotective effects of Fan on AD were investigated through a combination of Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation and behavioral assessments. Results and discussion: It was found that Fan effectively attenuated the amyloidogenic processing of APP by augmenting autophagy and subsequently fostering lysosomal degradation of BACE1 in N2AAPP cells, as reflected by the decrease in P62 levels, concomitant with the increase in Beclin-1 and LC3-II levels. More importantly, Fan significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment in an A\u03b21-42-induced mouse model of AD via the induction of autophagy and the inhibition of oxidative stress, as evidenced by an increase in antioxidants including glutathione reductase (GR), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and a decrease in pro-oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), coupled with a reduction in apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, our study demonstrate that Fan ameliorates cognitive dysfunction through promoting autophagy and mitigating oxidative stress, making it a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "To investigate the effect of \"Tongdu Qishen\" acupuncture\uff3bdredging the Govern Vessel and normalizing mental activities, electroacupuncture (EA) of \"Baihui\" (GV20), \"Yintang\" (EX-HN3) and \"Shuigou\" (GV26) needling\uff3don the learning-memory ability and the mechanism of ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. Twenty-four male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were randomly and equally divided into model group and EA group, and 12 normal C57BL/6 mice were used as the control group. In the EA group, EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 20 min) was applied to GV20 and EX-HN3 in combination with manual acupuncture stimulation of GV26. The treatment was performed once a day, for a total of 28 days. The mice in the three groups were given the same fixation and grasping operation. Morris water maze swimming tests were used to assess the mice's learning-memory ability. Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the morphological changes of neurons in the hippocampus. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus tissue was detected by superoxide anionic colorimetric assay kit (WST-1), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were detected by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. The expression levels of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (ptgs2) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA in the hippocampus were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR. Behavioral results showed that compared with the control group, the escape latencies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th day of Morris water maze swimming test were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the swimming time in the original platform quadrant and the times of cros-sing the original platform were considerably decreased (P<0.05) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the escape latencies at the 4th and 5th day were strikingly decreased (P<0.05), and the swimming time in the original platform quadrant and times of crossing the original platform significantly increased (P<0.05) in the EA group. Following modeling, the SOD activity and the expression of GPX4 mRNA were obviously down-regulated (P<0.05), and the content of MDA and the expression of ptgs2 mRNA significantly up-regulated (P<0.05) in the model group rele-vant to the control group. The SOD activity and the expression of GPX4 mRNA were apparently increased (P<0.05), and the content of MDA and the expression of ptgs2 mRNA remarkably down-regulated (P<0.05) in the EA group rele-vant to the model group. Histopathological and ultrastructural results showed scattered arrangement of cells, widened space among cells, reduction in the number of cells, and many shrunk of dissolved nucleoli, shrunking and incomplete mitochondria, and high membrane electron density in the hippocampus of the model group, which was relatively milder in the EA group. \"Tongdu Qishen\" acupuncture can improve the learning-memory ability of AD mice, which may be related to its functions in up-regulating SOD activity and GPX4 mRNA expression, and down-regulating MDA content and ptgs2 mRNA expression to reduce the lipid peroxidation in the process of ferroptosis. \u76ee\u7684: \u89c2\u5bdf\u201c\u901a\u7763\u542f\u795e\u201d\u9488\u6cd5\u5bf9\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u5b66\u4e60\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u94c1\u6b7b\u4ea1\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u63d0\u9ad8\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u5b66\u4e60\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: APPswe/PS1dE9\u5c0f\u9f20\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u548c\u9488\u523a\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ee5C57BL/6\u5c0f\u9f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec4\u540412\u53ea\u3002\u9488\u523a\u7ec4\u4e88\u7535\u9488\u201c\u767e\u4f1a\u201d\u201c\u5370\u5802\u201d\u5e76\u70b9\u523a\u201c\u6c34\u6c9f\u201d\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e51\u6b21\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b2120 min\uff0c\u517128 d\u3002\u91c7\u7528Morris\u6c34\u8ff7\u5bab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c0f\u9f20\u5b66\u4e60\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5c3c\u6c0f\u67d3\u8272\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c0f\u9f20\u6d77\u9a6c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u53ca\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528WST-1\u6cd5\u548cTBA\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c0f\u9f20\u6d77\u9a6c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u8d85\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u6b67\u5316\u9176\uff08SOD\uff09\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e19\u4e8c\u919b\uff08MDA\uff09\u542b\u91cf\uff1b\u5b9e\u65f6\u8367\u5149\u5b9a\u91cfPCR\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c0f\u9f20\u6d77\u9a6c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u524d\u5217\u817a\u7d20\u5185\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5408\u91762\uff08ptgs2\uff09\u3001\u8c37\u80f1\u7518\u80bd\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u91764\uff08GPX4\uff09mRNA\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5c0f\u9f20\u7b2c2\u20145\u5929\u9003\u907f\u6f5c\u4f0f\u671f\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u5e73\u53f0\u8c61\u9650\u6e38\u6cf3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u539f\u5e73\u53f0\u6b21\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cSOD\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cMDA\u542b\u91cf\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cptgs2 mRNA\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cGPX4 mRNA\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9488\u523a\u7ec4\u7b2c4\u20145\u5929\u9003\u907f\u6f5c\u4f0f\u671f\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u5e73\u53f0\u8c61\u9650\u6e38\u6cf3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u539f\u5e73\u53f0\u6b21\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cSOD\u6d3b\u6027\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cMDA\u542b\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cptgs2 mRNA\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cGPX4 mRNA\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6d77\u9a6c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6392\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u6563\u4e71\uff0c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u76b1\u7f29\uff0c\u5d74\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u523a\u7ec4\u4e0a\u8ff0\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \u201c\u901a\u7763\u542f\u795e\u201d\u9488\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8APPswe/PS1dE9\u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u6325\u795e\u7ecf\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u4f53\u6297\u6c27\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u80de\u94c1\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6709\u5173\u3002.",

Five-month-old APP/PS1 male mice were randomly divided into model and moxibustion (Moxi) groups, and C57BL/6J mice of the same age were as the control group, with 9 mice in each group. In the Moxi group, moxibustion was applied at \"Baihui\" (GV20) and \"Yongquan\" (KI1) for 30 min, once a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The spatial learning memory ability was observed by the Morris water maze test. The relative expressions of IL-33 and ST2 in hippocampus were detected by Western blot. The positive expression of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), IL-33/ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1(Iba-1), ST2/Iba-1, arginase 1 (Arg1)/Iba-1 and indu-cible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/Iba-1 in hippocampal CA1 region were detected by immunofluorescence.

Thirty-nine percent had neither A\u03b2 nor SVD (A-V-), 21% had SVD only (A-V+), 23% A\u03b2 only (A+V-), and 17% had both (A+V+). Pooled cohort linear mixed model analyses demonstrated that compared to A-V- (reference), A+V- had a faster rate of cognitive decline. Co-morbid SVD (A+V+) did not further increase rate of decline. Cox regression showed that dementia risk was modestly increased in A-V+ (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval: 1.8 [1.0-3.2]) and most strongly in A+ groups. Also, mortality risk was increased in A+ groups. In non-demented persons A\u03b2 was predictive of cognitive decline, dementia, and mortality. SVD modestly predicts dementia in A-, but did not increase deleterious effects in A+. Amyloid beta (A\u03b2; A) was predictive for cognitive decline, dementia, and mortality.

        "AbstractText": "The study aimed to assess whether individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) experience restricted access to hospitals' high-volume preferred skilled nursing facility (SNF) partners. The data source includes acute care hospital to SNF transitions identified using 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, 2017-2019. We model and compare the estimated effect of facility \"preferredness\" on SNF choice for patients with and without ADRD. We use conditional logistic regression with a 1:1 patient sample otherwise matched on demographic and encounter characteristics. Our matched sample included 58,190 patients, selected from a total observed population of 3,019,260 Medicare hospitalizations that resulted in an SNF transfer between 2017 and 2019. Overall, patients with ADRD have a lower probability of being discharged to a preferred SNF (52.0% vs. 54.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Choice model estimation using our matched sample suggests similarly that the marginal effect of preferredness on a patient choosing a proximate SNF is 2.4 percentage points lower for patients with ADRD compared with those without (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The differential effect of preferredness based on ADRD status increases when considering (a) the cumulative effect of multiple SNFs in close geographic proximity, (b) the magnitude of the strength of hospital-SNF relationship, and (c) comparing patients with more versus less advanced ADRD. Preferred relationships are significantly predictive of where a patient receives SNF care, but this effect is weaker for patients with ADRD. To the extent that these high-volume relationships are indicative of more targeted transitional care improvements from hospitals, ADRD patients may not be fully benefiting from these investments. Hospital leaders can leverage integrated care relationships to reduce SNFs' perceived need to engage in selection behavior (i.e., enhanced resource sharing and transparency in placement practices). Policy intervention may be needed to address selection behavior and to support hospitals in making systemic improvements that can better benefit all SNF partners (i.e., more robust information sharing systems).",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment. It is common in the elderly. Etiologically, dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmitter system is prominent in AD. However, disease modifying drug for AD is still unavailable. We hypothesized that krill oil and modified krill oil containing 20 % lysophosphatidylcholine-docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA, LPC20K) could play a crucial role in AD by improving cognitive functions measured by several behavioral tests. We found that LPC20K could ameliorate short-term, long-term, spatial, and object recognition memory under cholinergic hypofunction states. To find the underlying mechanism involved in the effect of LPC20K on cognitive function, we investigated changes of signaling molecules using Western blotting. Expression levels of protein kinase C zeta (PKC\u03b6) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \u2161 (CaMK\u2161), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were significantly increased in LPC20K-administered group compared to those in the memory impairment group. Moreover, the expression levels of BDNF were temporally increased especially 6 or 9\u00a0h after administration of LPC20K compared with the control group. These results suggest that LPC20K could ameliorate memory impairment caused by hypocholinergic state by enhancing the expression levels of PKC\u03b6 and PSD-95, and phosphorylation levels of ERK, CaMK\u2161 and CREB and increasing BDNF expression levels. Therefore, LPC20K could be used as a dietary supplement against cognitive impairment observed in diseases such as AD with a hypocholinergic state.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulating evidence suggests that nanoplastics contribute to an increased risk of brain damage, however, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we subjected mice to long-term exposure to amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (APS-NPs). These nanoplastics were detected in the mouse brain; coupled with the observed upregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes (APP and MAPT). To further explore nanoplastic damage mechanisms and the corresponding protective strategies against these mechanisms in vitro, we used hCMEC/D3 and HT22 cells. Results showed that APS-NPs disrupted tight junction proteins (Occludin and ZO-1) via TLR2/MMP9 axis, resulting in blood-brain barrier permeation; this was significantly mitigated by functional food Camellia pollen treatment. APS-NPs initiated iNOS and nNOS upregulation within neurons resulting in Sirtuin 1 deacetylase inactivation and CBP acetyltransferase stimulation, ultimately leading to Ac-Tau formation. This process was attenuated by Camellia pollen, which also ameliorated the APS-NPs-induced neuronal apoptosis mediated by the p53/Bax/Bcl-2 axis. Network pharmacology analysis of Camellia pollen offered a further theoretical understanding of its potential applications in preventing and treating nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study established that Camellia pollen protects the brain against APS-NPs-mediated blood-brain barrier damage and alleviates neuronal apoptosis and Alzheimer's disease-like neurotoxicity. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying polystyrene-induced brain damage and can be used to inform future prevention and treatment strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases have been one of the major concerns for human health. Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7\u00a0\u03bcg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. This study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model.",

        "AbstractText": "Nitric Oxide (NO), a significant gasotransmitter in biological systems, plays a crucial role in neurological diseases and cancer. Currently, there is a lack of effective methods for rapidly and sensitively identifying NO and elucidating its relationship with neurological diseases. Novel diamino-cyclic-metalloiridium phosphorescence probes, Ir-CDA and Ir-BDA, have been designed to visualize the gasotransmitter NO in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM). Ir-CDA and Ir-BDA utilize iridium (III) as the central ion and incorporate a diamino group as a ligand. The interaction between the diamino structure and NO leads to the formation of a three-nitrogen five-membered ring structure, which opens up phosphorescence. The two probes can selectively bind to NO and offer low detection limits. Additionally, Ir-BDA/Ir-CDA can image NO in brain cancer cell models, neuroinflammatory models, and AD cell models. Furthermore, the NO content in fresh brain sections from AD mice was considerably higher than that in wild-type (WT) mice. Consequently, it is plausible that NO is generated in significant quantities around cells hosting larger A\u03b2 deposits, gradually diffusing throughout the entire brain region. Furthermore, we posit that this phenomenon is a key factor contributing to the higher brain NO content in AD mice compared to that in WT mice. This discovery offers novel insights into the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

The study was based on the randomly selected cohort of the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale. Participants also received a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, while the clinical diagnoses of dementia and mild cognitive impairment were established according to international diagnostic criteria. Statistical analyses relied on comparison tests and a logistic (proportional odds) ordinal regression model. Depressive symptoms were detected in 19.5% of the 1936 study participants, while 11.3% of both people with MCI and dementia had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. The regression model revealed that older adults with more severe depressive symptoms were more likely female, cognitively impaired, less educated, were treated with psychotropic medication and lived in Attica versus Thessaly. Since depressive symptoms were detected in almost one in five older adults, healthcare professionals in Greece should safeguard the timely detection and effective treatment of such symptoms and the post-diagnostic care of older adults with depression. Depressive symptoms are present in approximately 20% of older adults.More than 10% of older individuals with dementia or mild cognitive impairment report moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms.Female sex, lower education, lower cognitive performance, living in urban areas and treatment with psychotropic medication pertain to more severe depressive symptoms in ageing.Timely detection and effective treatment of depressive symptoms are crucial in the clinical practice of the care of older adults.Further research is needed in order to elucidate the complex relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment in ageing.",

        "AbstractText": "Blood biomarkers showed values for predicting future cognitive impairment. Evidence from the community-based cohort was limited only in high-income countries. This study included 1857 dementia-free community residents recruited in 2009-2011 and followed up in waves 2014-2016 and 2019-2023 in the Shanghai Aging Study. We intended to explore the relationships of baseline plasma ALZpath phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), p-tau181, neurofilament light chain (NfL) with follow-up incident dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyloidosis. Higher concentrations of plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, and NfL were correlated to higher decline speed of Mini-Mental State Examination score, and higher risk of incident dementia and AD. The p-tau217 demonstrated a significant correlation with longitudinal neocortical amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57 [0.30, 0.76]) and a high accuracy differentiating A\u03b2+ from A\u03b2- at follow-ups (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\u00a0=\u00a00.821 [0.703, 0.940]). Plasma p-tau217 may be an early predictive marker of AD and A\u03b2 pathology in older community-dwelling individuals.Highlights: Plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, and NfL were positively associated with long-term cognitive decline and risk of incident dementia.Plasma p-tau217 showed a better performance distinguishing A\u03b2+ individuals from A\u03b2- individuals at follow-ups.Plasma NfL may be a suitable predictor of general cognitive decline in older community-dwelling individuals.",

        "AbstractText": "By utilizing a high-temperature superconducting quantum interference device (high-Tc SQUID) magnetometer, an alternating current (AC) magnetosusceptometer, referred to as an analyzer, was developed for ultrasensitive immunoassays. The analyzer has been applied to assay biomarkers in human plasma associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The involved assay methodology is the so-called immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). Such an analyzer has been approved for clinical use in Taiwan and Europe. The mass production of the analyzer is needed for clinical utilities. The issue of exploring analyzer-to-analyzer variations in the performances becomes critical. Unfortunately, there is no standard characterization to determine the variations in performances among analyzers. In this study, key characterizations, such as output signal stability, signal-to-noise ratio, measured concentrations of a control sample, etc., are proposed. In total, three analyzers are characterized in this work. The detected biomarkers include amyloid peptides, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein, and \u03b1-synuclein protein for AD and PD. Through one-way ANOVA for any of the characterizations among the three analyzers, it was found that there was no significant difference in any of these characterizations among the analyzers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the three analyzers are applied to assay biomolecules for AD and PD in reference samples. High correlations (r > 0.8) in measured concentrations of any of these biomarkers in reference samples were obtained among the three analyzers. The results demonstrate that the proposed characterizations are feasible for achieving consistent performance among high-Tc SQUID-based AC magnetosusceptometers for assaying biomolecules.",

        "AbstractText": "While Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia have rapidly become a global health crisis with growing incidence that is unabated, the incidence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) far exceeds that of Alzheimer's disease. Persons with MCI demonstrate some level of cognitive impairment, but daily functions remain intact and there is no certainty that they will develop dementia. Yet, the possibility conjures a considerable amount of fear and anxiety, further fueled by a vast array of misconceptions and stigma. The pervasive nature of this stigma permeates society and culture at many levels. Persons with MCI who are at higher risk for development of dementia may be especially vulnerable to fear and stigma associated with the diagnosis. Based on this premise, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stigma and perceived stress in persons with MCI and their care partners, including the relationship between income and the study variables. The secondary aim was to examine the effect of a combined cognitive rehabilitation and wellness program on these perceptions. Thirty participants were recruited from Mayo Clinic's Health Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program. MCI (n\u2009=\u200915) and care partner (n\u2009=\u200915) participants completed the Stigma Impact Scale (SIS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before and after the HABIT program. Average SIS and PSS scores decreased in the MCI, care partner, and combined groups, both pre- and post-HABIT. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between perceived stigma and stress, controlling for income. A significant relationship was found between perceived stigma and perceived stress both pre and post-HABIT. The results suggest a relationship exists between perceived stigma and perceived stress in persons with MCI and their care partners, and an educational program such as HABIT may strengthen this relationship by informing participants of potential challenges that occur in cognitive decline. Understanding these relationships may provide an opportunity to provide tools for this vulnerable population.",

        "AbstractText": "Spontaneous activity during the resting state, tracked by BOLD fMRI imaging, or shortly rsfMRI, gives rise to brain-wide dynamic patterns of interregional correlations, whose structured flexibility relates to cognitive performance. Here, we analyze resting-state dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in a cohort of older adults, including amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, N = 34) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, N = 13) patients, as well as normal control (NC, N = 16) and cognitively \"supernormal\" controls (SNC, N = 10) subjects. Using complementary state-based and state-free approaches, we find that resting-state fluctuations of different functional links are not independent but are constrained by high-order correlations between triplets or quadruplets of functionally connected regions. When contrasting patients with healthy subjects, we find that dFC between cingulate and other limbic regions is increasingly bursty and intermittent when ranking the four groups from SNC to NC, aMCI and AD. Furthermore, regions affected at early stages of AD pathology are less involved in higher order interactions in patient than in control groups, while pairwise interactions are not significantly reduced. Our analyses thus suggest that the spatiotemporal complexity of dFC organization is precociously degraded in AD and provides a richer window into the underlying neurobiology than time-averaged FC connections.",

Recent research highlights the role of NMDA receptors in AD development, as excessive activation of these receptors triggers excitotoxicity. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, shows promise in curbing excitotoxicity. What sets our study apart is our novel exploration of memantine's potential to protect hippocampal neurons from neurotoxicity induced by NMDA and amyloid \u03b21-42, a hallmark of AD. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments using rat hippocampal cell cultures. We employed Hoechst and propidium iodide double staining to assess neuronal viability. Analyzing the viability of neurons in normal conditions compared to their status after 24\u2009h of exposure to the respective agents revealed compelling results. The incubation of hippocampal neurons with NMDA or amyloid \u03b21-42 led to a more than twofold increase in the number of apoptotic and necrotic neurons. However, when memantine was co-administered with NMDA or amyloid \u03b21-42, we witnessed a notable augmentation in the number of viable cells. This unique approach not only suggests that memantine may act as a neuroprotective agent but also emphasizes the relevance of hippocampal neuron cultures as valuable models for investigating excitotoxicity and potential AD treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "In the past 50 years, life expectancy has increased by more than 20 years. One consequence of this increase in longevity is the rise of age-related diseases such as dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60-70% of cases. AD pathogenesis is not restricted to the neuronal compartment but includes strong interactions with other brain cells, particularly microglia triggering the release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. There is growing evidence revealing the diverse clinical benefits of postbiotics in many prevalent conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we tested the ability of bacterial conditioned media (BCM) derived from selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains to regulate core mechanisms relevant to AD pathophysiology in the microglia cell line BV-2. Levilactobacillus brevis CRL 2013, chosen for its efficient production of the neurotransmitter GABA, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis CRL 581, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, were selected alongside Enterococcus mundtii CRL 35, a LAB strain that can significantly modulate cytokine production. BCM from all 3 strains displayed antioxidant capabilities, reducing oxidative stress triggered by beta-amyloid oligomers (oA\u03b21-42). Additionally, BCM effectively mitigated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, namely, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 triggered by oA\u03b21-42. Furthermore, our study identified that BCM from CRL 581 inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a crucial enzyme in AD progression, in both human erythrocytes and mouse brain tissues. Notably, the inhibitory effect was mediated by low-molecular-weight components of the BCM. L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CRL 581 emerged as a favorable candidate for production of postbiotics with potential benefits for AD therapy since it demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, reduction of cytokine expression, and partial AChE inhibition. On the other hand, E. mundtii CRL 35 showed that the antioxidant activity failed to inhibit AChE and caused induction of iNOS expression, rendering it unsuitable as a potential therapeutic for AD. This study unveils the potential benefits of LAB-derived postbiotics for the development of new avenues for therapeutic interventions for AD.",

MBI was derived from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) using a published algorithm. SD was determined using the NPI-Q nighttime behaviors item. Cox proportional hazard regressions with time-dependant variables for MBI, SD, and cognitive diagnosis were used to model associations between baseline 1) MBI and incident SD (n\u200a=\u200a11,277); 2) SD and incident MBI (n\u200a=\u200a10,535); 3) MBI with concurrent SD and incident dementia (n\u200a=\u200a13,544); and 4) MBI without concurrent SD and incident dementia (n\u200a=\u200a11,921). Models were adjusted for first-visit age, sex, education, cognitive diagnosis, race, and for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The rate of developing SD was 3.1-fold higher in older adults with MBI at baseline compared to those without MBI (95% CI: 2.8-3.3). The rate of developing MBI was 1.5-fold higher in older adults with baseline SD than those without SD (95% CI: 1.3-1.8). The rate of developing dementia was 2.2-fold greater in older adults with both MBI and SD, as opposed to SD alone (95% CI:1.9-2.6). There is a bidirectional relationship between MBI and SD. Older adults with SD develop dementia at higher rates when co-occurring with MBI.

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a type of sphingolipid found in cell membranes, and recent evidence suggests a potential link between SM and AD. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear. To elucidate the potential causal relationship between SM levels and the risk of developing AD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach. The study utilized data extracted from the genome wide association study database. The primary analysis method was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, which was supplemented by weighted median, weighted mode, and MR Egger methods. The study specifically investigated the bidirectional causal relationship between SM and AD, evaluating odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Elevated levels of SM were found to be a risk factor for AD, as shown by IVW(MRE) [OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000 to 1.002; p\u200a=\u200a0.020\u200a<\u200a0.05], IVW(FE) [OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001 to 1.002; p\u200a=\u200a3.36e-07\u200a<\u200a0.05], and MR Egger.

To investigate whether amyloid abnormality and vascular burden synergistically contribute to cognitive decline in a memory clinic population. We included 227 patients from Maastricht and Aachen memory clinics. Amyloid abnormality (A+) was defined by CSF A\u03b242 using data-driven cut-offs. Vascular burden (V+) was defined as having moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities, or any microbleeds, macrohemorrhage or infarcts on MRI. Longitudinal change in global cognition, memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and verbal fluency was analysed across the A-V-, A-V+, A+V-, A+V+ groups by linear mixed models. Additionally, individual MRI measures, vascular risk and vascular disease were used as V definitions. At baseline, the A+V+ group scored worse on global cognition and verbal fluency compared to all other groups, and showed worse memory compared to A-V+ and A-V- groups. Over time (mean 2.7+ - 1.5 years), A+V+ and A+V- groups showed faster global cognition decline than A-V+ and A-V- groups. Only the A+V- group showed decline on memory and verbal fluency. The A-V+ group did not differ from the A-V- group. Individual MRI vascular measures only indicated an independent association of microbleeds with executive functioning decline.

        "AbstractText": "Tauopathies are a subset of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal tau inclusions. Recently, we have discovered a new, human specific, tau isoform termed W-tau that originates by intron 12 retention. Our preliminary data suggests this newly discovered W-tau isoform might prevent aberrant aggregation of other tau isoforms but is significantly downregulated in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. To accurately predict, examine, and understand tau protein structure and the conformational basis for the neuroprotective role of W-tau. A tridimensional deep learning-based approach and in vitro polymerization assay was included to accurately predict, analyze, and understand tau protein structure and the conformational basis for the neuroprotective role of W-tau. Our findings demonstrate: a) the predicted protein tridimensionality structure of the tau isoforms raised by intron retention and their comparison with the other tau isoforms; b) the interaction of W-tau peptide (from W-tau isoform) with other tau isoforms; c) the effect of W-tau peptide in the polymerization of those tau isoforms. This study supports the importance of the structure-function relationship on the neuroprotective behavior of W-tau inhibiting tau fibrillization in vitro.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent dementia, affecting a large number of populations. Despite being under scrutiny for decades, an effective therapeutic option is still not available. This study explores the therapeutic role of a nootropic herb Bacopa monnieri (BM) in AD-like pathological conditions produced by injecting preformed amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b242) fibril bilaterally into hippocampus of Wistar rats, and ethanolic extract of BM is orally administered for 4 weeks. Assessment of behavioral changes reveals that BM treatment ameliorates A\u03b242-induced cognitive impairment and compromised explorative behavior. Supplementation of BM also reduces oxidative stress biomarkers, proinflammatory cytokines, and cholinesterase activity in the AD rats. Additionally, BM treatment restores Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/ B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) imbalance, increases neurotrophic factors expression, and prevents neurodegeneration validated by quantifying Nissl-positive hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, BM administration eliminates amyloid plaques in the hippocampal region and normalizes the A\u03b242-induced increase in phospho-tau and total tau expression. Mechanistic investigations reveal that BM interacts with glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3\u03b2) and restores Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. BM has been used in diet as a nootropic herb for several centuries. This study highlights the anti-Alzheimer activity of BM from the behavioral to the molecular level by modulating mitochondrial dysfunction, and GSK-3\u03b2 mediates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia are involved in synaptic pruning and mediate synapse loss. LINGO-1 is a negative regulator of nerve growth, and whether antagonizing LINGO-1 can attenuate synaptic pruning by microglia and rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus in AD is still unclear. On this basis, the anti-LINGO-1 antibody, which binds to LINGO-1 protein and antagonizes the effects of LINGO-1, was administered to 10-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice for 2\u00a0months. The Morris water maze test, immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction were used. Compared to wild-type mice, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had worse performance on behavioral tests, fewer dendritic spines but more microglia in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, the microglia in APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more branches of medium length (4-6\u00a0\u00b5m) and a cell body area with greater variability. Moreover, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more postsynaptic termini colocalized with microglia in the hippocampus than wild-type mice. The anti-LINGO-1 antibody significantly reversed these changes in AD, indicating that the anti-LINGO-1 antibody can improve hippocampus-dependent learning and memory abilities and effectively rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus of AD mice and that microglia might participate in this progression in AD. These results provide a scientific basis for further studying the mechanism of the anti-LINGO-1 antibody in AD and help to elucidate the role of LINGO-1 in the treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Paraoxonase (PON) enzymes (PON1, PON2 and PON3) exert antioxidant properties through arylesterase, lactonase and paraoxonase activities. Increasing findings suggested their potential involvement, particularly PON1 and PON2, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by early oxidative stress. Specifically, decreased serum PON1-arylesterase and lactonase activities seem to be associated with an increased brain oxidative damage in early AD, leading to hypothesize that PON activity alterations might be an early event in AD. To address this hypothesis, the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; i.e. a marker of oxidative stress damage) along with the protein expression and enzymatic activity of PON1 and PON2 have been investigated in the brain and serum of young [Postnatal day (PD)8-10, 20-25 and 60-65] asymptomatic 3xTg-AD female mice, one of the most used transgenic models of AD. At PD 8-10, there were no differences in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) 4-HNE expression levels between 3xTg-AD mice compared to controls (Non-Tg mice). On the other hand, significant increased levels of 4-HNE were detected in PD 20-30 3xTg-AD mice hippocampus, while a significant reduction was observed in 3xTg-AD group at PD 60-65. In the PFC, 4-HNE levels were significantly reduced in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30, while no differences in 4-HNE levels were detected at PD 60-65. No significant differences in arylesterase and lactonase activities were observed in the plasma of 3xTg-AD and Non-Tg mice at the different considered ages. Compared to Non-Tg mice, a reduction of brain arylesterase activity was found in 3xTg-AD female at PD 20-30 and PD 60-65, but it was significant only in the younger group. Finally, a similar trend was observed also for PON1 and PON2 protein levels, with both significantly, and solely, decreased in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30. Overall, these findings suggest that the altered oxidative stress homeostasis in the 3xTg-AD female mice may be related to an early reduction in activity and expression of PONs enzymes most likely via a reduced brain arylesterases activity.",

It is projected that the number of affected individuals will reach a staggering 150 million by 2050. While recent advancements in monoclonal antibodies targeting A\u03b2 have shown some clinical effects, there is an urgent need for improved therapies to effectively address the impeding surge of AD patients worldwide. To achieve this, a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying the disease is crucial. In recent years, mounting evidence has underscored the vital role of the innate immune system in AD pathology. However, limited findings persist regarding the involvement of the adaptive immune system. Here, we report on the impact of the adaptive immune system on various aspects of AD by using AppNL-G-F mice crossed into a Rag2-/- background lacking mature adaptive immune cells. In addition, to simulate the continuous exposure to various challenges such as infections that is commonly observed in humans, the innate immune system was activated through the repetitive induction of peripheral inflammation. We observed a remarkably improved performance on complex cognitive tasks when a mature adaptive immune system is absent. Notably, this observation is pathologically associated with lower A\u03b2 plaque accumulation, reduced glial activation, and better-preserved neuronal networks in the mice lacking a mature adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings highlight the detrimental role of the adaptive immune system in AD and underscore the need for effective strategies to modulate it for therapeutic purposes.",

We propose a novel distributed algorithm for fitting regularized Cox proportional hazards model when data sharing among different data providers is restricted. Based on cyclical coordinate descent, the proposed algorithm computes intermediary statistics by each site and then exchanges them to update the model parameters in other sites without accessing individual patient-level data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world data analysis predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Moreover, we compared the performance of our method with existing privacy-preserving models. Our algorithm achieves privacy-preserving variable selection for time-to-event data in the vertically distributed setting, without degradation of accuracy compared with a centralized approach. Simulation demonstrates that our algorithm is highly efficient in analyzing high-dimensional datasets. Real-world data analysis reveals that our distributed Cox model yields higher accuracy in predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia than the conventional Cox model built by each data provider without data sharing. Moreover, our algorithm is computationally more efficient compared with existing privacy-preserving Cox models with or without regularization term. The proposed algorithm is lossless, privacy-preserving and highly efficient to fit regularized Cox model for vertically distributed data.

It has been shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) based on phytomedicines enhances the therapeutic effects of modern medicine when taken in conjunction with them. Modern medicine N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist memantine (Mm) are mainly used in the clinical treatment of AD. TCM Cerebralcare Granule\u00ae (CG) has long been an effective treatment for headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. In this study, we employ a blend of CG and Mm to address Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms and explore their impacts and underlying mechanisms. The objective of our study was to observe the effects of CG combined with Memantine (Mm) on learning and memory impairment of AD mice induced by D-galactose and to explore the mechanism at work. CG and Mm were combined to target multiple pathological processes involved in AD. For a thorough analysis, we performed various experiments such as behavioral detection, pathological detection, proteomic detection, and other experimental methods of detection. It was found that the combination of CG and Mm was significantly effective for improving learning and memory in AD mice as well as brain pathology. The serum and hippocampal tissue of AD mice were significantly enhanced with catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were decreased with this treatment. In AD mice, a combination of Mm and CG (CG\u00a0+\u00a0Mm) significantly increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10, decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), improved synaptic plasticity by restoring synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus, enhanced A\u03b2 phagocytosis of microglia in AD mice, and increased mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, III, and IV, lead to an increase in the number of functionally active NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.

Most proteins showed significant enriched signal transduction pathway profiles after CG\u00a0+\u00a0Mm treatment, based on the KEGG pathway database.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which accounts for the most cases of dementia worldwide. Impaired memory, including acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval, is one of the hallmarks in AD. At the cellular level, dysregulated synaptic plasticity partly due to reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long-term depression (LTD) underlies the memory deficits in AD. GluA3 containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are one of key receptors involved in rapid neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies revealed a novel form of GluA3 involved in neuronal plasticity that is dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), rather than N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). However, this cAMP-dependent GluA3 pathway is specifically and significantly impaired by amyloid beta (A\u03b2), a pathological marker of AD. cAMP is a key second messenger that plays an important role in modulating memory and synaptic plasticity. We previously reported that exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2), acting as a main cAMP effector, plays a specific and time-limited role in memory retrieval. From electrophysiological perspective, Epac2 facilities the maintenance of LTP, a cellular event closely associated with memory retrieval. Additionally, Epac2 was found to be involved in the GluA3-mediated plasticity. In this review, we comprehensively summarize current knowledge regarding the specific roles of GluA3 and Epac2 in synaptic plasticity and memory, and their potential association with AD.",

To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we performed differential gene expression analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of older adults (n = 424) in relation to antemortem depressive symptoms. Additionally, we integrated genome-wide association study results for depression (n\u00a0= 500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 14,048 unique genes in 7 cell types and 52 cell subtypes to perform a transcriptome-wide association study of depression followed by Mendelian randomization. Our single-nucleus transcriptome-wide association study analysis identified 68 candidate genes for depression and showed the greatest number being in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Of the 68 genes, 53 were novel compared to previous studies. Notably, gene expression in different neuronal subtypes had varying effects on depression risk. Traits with high genetic correlations with depression, such as neuroticism, shared more transcriptome-wide association study genes than traits that were not highly correlated with depression. Complementing these analyses, differential gene expression analysis across 52 neocortical cell subtypes showed that genes such as KCNN2, SCAI, WASF3, and SOCS6 were associated with late-life depressive symptoms in specific cell subtypes. These 2 sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large single-nucleus RNA sequencing data both to uncover genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depressive symptoms and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered genome-wide association studies so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development.",

The level of tangles in neurons correlates positively with severe dementia. However, how Tau induces cognitive dysfunction is still unknown, which leads to a lack of effective treatments for AD. Metal ions deposition occurs with tangles in AD brain autopsy. Reduced metal ion can improve the pathology of AD. To explore whether abnormally phosphorylated Tau causes metal ion deposition, we overexpressed human full-length Tau (hTau) in the hippocampal CA3 area of mice and primary cultured hippocampal neurons (CPHN) and found that Tau accumulation induced iron deposition and activated calcineurin (CaN), which dephosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2), mediating Tau hyperphosphorylation. Simultaneous activation of CaN dephosphorylates cyclic-AMP response binding protein (CREB), leading to synaptic deficits and memory impairment, as shown in our previous study; this seems to be a vicious cycle exacerbating tauopathy. In the current study, we developed a new metal ion chelator that displayed a significant inhibitory effect on Tau phosphorylation and memory impairment by chelating iron ions in vivo and in vitro.

Several tests of cognition are utilized in the diagnosis of cognitive decline that assess executive function, short- and long-term memory, cognitive flexibility, and speech and motor control. Recent studies have separately investigated the genetic component of both cognitive health, using these measures, and circulating fatty acids. We aimed to examine the potential moderating effect of main species of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on an individual's genetically conferred risk of cognitive decline. The Offspring cohort from the Framingham Heart Study was cross-sectionally analyzed in this genome-wide interaction study (GWIS). Our sample included all individuals with red blood cell \u03c9-3 PUFA, genetic, cognitive testing (via Trail Making Tests [TMTs]), and covariate data (N = 1620). We used linear mixed effects models to predict each of the 3 cognitive measures (TMT A, TMT B, and TMT D) by each \u03c9-3 PUFA, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (0, 1, or 2 minor alleles), \u03c9-3 PUFA by SNP interaction term, and adjusting for sex, age, education, APOE \u03b54 genotype status, and kinship (relatedness).

In this GWIS of \u03c9-3 PUFA species on cognitive outcomes, we identified 8 unique genes with plausible biology suggesting individuals with specific polymorphisms may have greater potential to benefit from increased \u03c9-3 PUFA intake.

        "AbstractText": "With no cure for Alzheimer disease (AD), current efforts involve therapeutics that prevent further cognitive impairment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been studied for its potential to mitigate AD symptoms. This systematic review investigates the efficacy of current and previous targets for their ability to slow cognitive decline in treating AD. A systematic review of the literature was performed through a search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Human studies between 1994 and 2023 were included. Sample size, cognitive outcomes, and complications were recorded for each study. Fourteen human studies were included: 7 studies with 6 distinct cohorts (n\u00a0= 56) targeted the fornix, 6 studies with 3 distinct cohorts (n\u00a0= 17) targeted the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), and 1 study (n\u00a0= 3) investigated DBS of the ventral striatum (VS). The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes were used as the primary outcomes. In 5 of 6 cohorts where DBS targeted the fornix, cognitive decline was slowed based on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale or Mini-Mental State Examination scores. In 2 of 3 NBM cohorts, a similar reduction was reported. When DBS targeted the VS, the patients' Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes scores indicated a slowed decline. This review summarizes current evidence and addresses variability in study designs regarding the therapeutic benefit of DBS of the fornix, NBM, and VS. Because of varying study parameters, varying outcome measures, varying study durations, and limited cohort sizes, definitive conclusions regarding the utility of DBS for AD cannot be made. Further investigation is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is becoming a growing global concern by being the second most prevalent disease next to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Henceforth new exploration is needed in search of new aspects towards the disease mechanism and origin. Evidence from recent studies has clearly stated the role of Gut Microbiota (GM) in the maintenance of the brain and as a root cause of various diseases and disorders including other neurological conditions. In the case of PD, with an unknown etiology, the GM is said to have a larger impact on the disease pathophysiology. Although GM and its metabolites are crucial for maintaining the normal physiology of the host, it is an undeniable fact that there is an influence of GM in the pathophysiology of PD. As such the Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs) in the epithelium of the intestine are one of the significant regulators of the gut-brain axis and act as a communication mediator between the gut and the brain. The communication is established via the molecules of neuroendocrine which are said to have a crucial part in neurological diseases such as AD, PD, and other psychiatry-related disorders. This review is focused on understanding the proper role of GM and EECs in PD. Here, we also focus on some of the metabolites and compounds that can interact with the PD genes causing various dysfunctions in the cell and facilitating the disease conditions using bioinformatical tools. Various mechanisms concerning EECs and PD, their identification, the latest studies, and available current therapies have also been discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "In addition to the well-known monomeric globular (G-actin) and polymeric fibrillar (F-actin) forms, actin can exist in the so-called inactivated form (I-actin). Hsp70 chaperon, prefoldin, and CCT chaperonin are required to obtain native globular state. In contrast, I-actin is spontaneously formed in the absence of intracellular folding machinery. I-actin can be obtained from G-actin by elimination of divalent ion, incubation in presence of small concentrations of denaturants, and by heat exposure. Since G-actin is a quasi-stationary, thermodynamically unstable form, it can gradually transform into inactivated state in the absence of chelating/denaturating agents or heat exposure, but the transition is much slower. I-actin was shown to associate into oligomers up to the molecular weight of 14-16\u00a0G-actin monomers, though the structure of these oligomers remains uncharacterized. This study employs small-angle X-ray scattering to reveal novel insights into the oligomerization process of such spontaneously formed inactivated actin. These oligomers are differentiated from F-actin through comparative analysis, highlighting a unique oligomerization pathway.",

Fifty animals were allocated to five groups, which received saline (vehicle control, group 1), a combination of saline and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) (disease control, group 2), coconut oil (COO) (SFE extracted, treatment group 3), turmeric oleoresin (Cur) (SFE extracted, treatment group 4) and SFE co-extract of turmeric powder and coconut shreds (CurCOO) (treatment group 5). Animals were subjected to behavioural evaluation. In addition, the hippocampal section of the brain from all groups was subjected to biochemical, molecular and histopathological evaluations. The results showed CurCOO administered intranasally improved cognitive abilities, reversed histological alterations in the brain, reduced hippocampus inflammation studied through proinflammatory cytokine markers like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as compared to the disease control group. The impact of CurCOO on preventive neurodegeneration was also observed through a reduction in protein transcription factor NF-kB in the treated group 5 as compared to a disease control group. The effect of intranasal delivery of CurCOO on the neurons responsible for memory consolidation was evident from low acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in the treated groups with respect to AlCl3 induced group. Summarily, the results demonstrated intranasal delivery of CurCOO to show better efficacy than Cur and COO in preventing neurodegeneration associated with AlCl3 induced Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a widespread neurodegenerative disorder marked by the gradual onset of memory impairment, predominantly impacting the elderly. With projections indicating a substantial surge in AD diagnoses, exceeding 13.8 million individuals by 2050, there arises an urgent imperative to discern novel biomarkers for AD. To accomplish these objectives, we explored immune cell infiltration and the expression patterns of immune cells and immune function-related genes of AD patients. Furthermore, we utilized the consensus clustering method combined with aggrephagy-related genes (ARGs) for typing AD patients and categorized AD specimens into distinct clusters (C1, C2). A total of 272 candidate genes were meticulously identified through a combination of differential analysis and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, we applied three machine learning algorithms-namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and generalized linear model (GLM)-to pinpoint a pathogenic signature comprising five genes associated with AD. To validate the predictive accuracy of these identified genes in discerning AD progression, we constructed nomograms. Our analyses uncovered that cluster C2 exhibits a higher immune expression than C1. Based on the ROC(0.956). We identified five characteristic genes (PFKFB4, PDK3, KIAA0319L, CEBPD, and PHC2T) associated with AD immune cells and function. The nomograms constructed on the basis of these five diagnostic genes demonstrated effectiveness. In the validation group, the ROC values were found to be 0.760 and 0.838, respectively. These results validate the robustness and reliability of the diagnostic model, affirming its potential for accurate identification of AD. Our findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD but also offer valuable insights for drug development and clinical analysis. The limitation of our study is the limited sample size, and although AD-related genes were identified and some of the mechanisms elucidated, further experiments are needed to elucidate the more in-depth mechanisms of these characterized genes in the disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the motor system. It is mainly caused by the loss of dopamine due to the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Previous studies have reported that immunization may be a potential preventive strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the aim of the study was to design an \u03b1-syn specific epitope vaccine and investigate its effect in PD-related pathophysiology using an \u03b1-syn-induced mouse model. We used an in silico model to identify and design a non-toxic \u03b1-syn-based peptide epitope vaccine and, to overcome poor immunogenicity, the vaccine was coupled with immunogenic carrier proteins, i.e., ovalbumin (OVA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Our results showed that vaccinated PD mouse models, especially with vaccines with carrier proteins, improved in motor functions compared with the non-vaccinated PD model. Additionally, the vaccinated groups showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the spleen and plasma as well as decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the plasma. Furthermore, vaccinated groups, especially OVA and KLH groups, showed decrease in \u03b1-syn levels and increased dopamine-related markers, i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT), and autophagy activities in the striatum and SNpc. Lastly, our data showed decreased neuroinflammation by reducing the activation of microglia and astrocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunized groups, especially with OVA and KLH carrier proteins. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination, especially with immunogenic carrier proteins, is effective in reducing the accumulation of \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain and ameliorate PD-related pathophysiology. Hence, further development of this approach might have a potential role in preventing the development of PD.",

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that medications that regulate the \"brain-gut\" axis can ameliorate disease symptoms of AD. Studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) is involved in intestinal metabolism to meet the goal of illness treatment. EGb is currently utilized extensively in the clinical prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, the regulatory effect of EGb on intestinal flora and its metabolites in AD pathology remains largely speculative. In this study, the Morris water maze test showed a significant improvement of spatial memory in the AD mouse model (APP/PS1 mice) after EGb treatment. We next confirmed the positive effects of EGb on the gut flora and metabolites of APP/PS1 mice and further showed that EGb treatment reshaped the disturbed gut microbiome, in particular by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Uroviricota, Streptophyta, and Spirochaetes. Meanwhile, a non-targeted metabolomics analysis showed that EGb treatment significantly reversed the dysfunction of the microbial metabolic phenotype by altering Limosilactobacillus and Parvibacte, with 300 differential metabolites modulated (131 up-regulated, 169 down-regulated). Our findings highlight the significant regulatory impact of EGb on intestinal microflora and microbial metabolism in AD mice models and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to either exogenous (PAMPs) or endogenous (DAMPs) stimuli results in the production of IL-18, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2. These cytokines have a beneficial role in promoting inflammation, but an excessive activation of the inflammasome and the consequent constitutive inflammatory status plays a role in human pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagic removal of NLRP3 inflammasome activators can reduce inflammasome activation and inflammation. Likewise, inflammasome signaling pathways regulate autophagy, allowing the development of inflammatory responses but preventing excessive and detrimental inflammation. Nanotechnology led to the development of liposome engineered nanovectors (NVs) that can load and carry drugs. We verified in an in vitro model of AD-associated inflammation the ability of Glibenclamide-loaded NVs (GNVs) to modulate the balance between inflammasome activation and autophagy. Human THP1dM cells were LPS-primed and oligomeric A\u00df-stimulated in the presence/absence of GNVs. IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and activated caspase-1 production was evaluated by the Automated Immunoassay System (ELLA); ASC speck formation (a marker of NLRP3 activation) was analyzed by FlowSight Imaging flow-cytometer (AMNIS); the expression of autophagy targets was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB); and the modulation of autophagy-related up-stream signaling pathways and Tau phosphorylation were WB-quantified. Results showed that GNVs reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and prevent the A\u00df-induced phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, and p70S6 kinases, potentiating autophagic flux and counteracting Tau phosphorylation. These preliminary results support the investigation of GNVs as a possible novel strategy in disease and rehabilitation to reduce inflammasome-associated inflammation.",

The association between AD and treatment with drugs targeting the beta-adrenergic receptor is controversial. The aim of this study is to assess the association between the initiation of AD medication and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) in adults. We conducted a prescription sequence symmetry analysis using the University of Groningen IADB.nl prescription database. We determined the order of the first prescription for treating AD and the first prescription for beta-blockers, with the dispensing date of the first prescription for AD defined as the index date. Participants were adults over 45 years old starting any AD medication and beta-blockers within two years. We calculated adjusted sequence ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We identified 510 users of both AD and beta-blockers, and 145 participants were eligible. The results were compatible with either a significant decrease in the incidence of AD after using beta-blockers (adjusted sequence ratio (aSR) = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35-0.72) or, conversely, an increase in beta-blockers after AD medication (aSR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.61-2.30).

MRI is able to detect a wide range of diseases and conditions, including nervous system disorders and cancer, and uses the principles of NMR relaxation to generate detailed internal images of the body. For such investigation, different metal complexes have been studied as potential MRI contrast agents. With this in mind, this work aims to investigate two systems containing the vanadium complexes [VO(metf)2]\u00b7H2O (VC1) and [VO(bpy)2Cl]+ (VC2), being metformin and bipyridine ligands of the respective complexes, with the biological targets AMPK and ULK1. These biomolecules are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively, and may act as promising spectroscopic probes for detection of these diseases. To initially evaluate the behavior of the studied ligands within the aforementioned protein active sites and aqueous environment, four classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including VC1 + H2O (1), VC2 + H2O (2), VC1 + AMPK + H2O (3), and VC2 + ULK1 + H2O (4) were performed. From this, it was obtained that for both systems containing VCs and water only, the theoretical calculations implied a higher efficiency when compared with DOTAREM, a famous commercially available contrast agent for MRI. This result is maintained when evaluating the system containing VC1 + AMPK + H2O. Nevertheless, for the system VC2 + ULK1 + H2O, there was observed a decrease in the vanadium complex efficiency due to the presence of a relevant steric hindrance. Despite that, due to the nature of the interaction between VC2 and ULK1, and the nature of its ligands, the study gives an insight that some modifications on VC2 structure might improve its efficiency as an MRI probe.",

The currently available drugs are prescribed for symptomatic treatment and present adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, hypertension, and weight loss. There is urgency in finding new drugs capable of preventing the progress of the disease, controlling the symptoms, and increasing the survival of patients with AD. This study aims to present new multipurpose compounds capable of simultaneously inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-responsible for recycling acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft-and beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1)-responsible for the generation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques.

        "AbstractText": "Type 10 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD10) is the HSD17B10 gene product playing an appreciable role in cognitive functions. It is the main hub of exercise-upregulated mitochondrial proteins and is involved in a variety of metabolic pathways including neurosteroid metabolism to regulate allopregnanolone homeostasis. Deacetylation of 17\u03b2-HSD10 by sirtuins helps regulate its catalytic activities. 17\u03b2-HSD10 may also play a critical role in the control of mitochondrial structure, morphology and dynamics by acting as a member of the Parkin/PINK1 pathway, and by binding to cyclophilin D to open mitochondrial permeability pore. 17\u03b2-HSD10 also serves as a component of RNase P necessary for mitochondrial tRNA maturation. This dehydrogenase can bind with the A\u03b2 peptide thereby enhancing neurotoxicity to brain cells. Even in the absence of A\u03b2, its quantitative and qualitative variations can result in neurodegeneration. Since elevated levels of 17\u03b2-HSD10 were found in brain cells of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and mouse AD models, it is considered to be a key factor in AD pathogenesis.

Results of this study would encourage researchers to solve the question why elevated levels of 17\u03b2-HSD10 are present in brains of AD patients and mouse AD models.

        "AbstractText": "Although the long-standing Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) has been largely discredited, its main attribute, the centrality of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains the cornerstone of any potential interpretation of the disease: All known AD-causing mutations, without a single exception, affect, in one way or another, A\u03b2. The ACH2.0, a recently introduced theory of AD, preserves this attribute but otherwise differs fundamentally from the ACH. It posits that AD is a two-stage disorder where both stages are driven by intraneuronal (rather than extracellular) A\u03b2 (iA\u03b2) albeit of two distinctly different origins. The first asymptomatic stage is the decades-long accumulation of A\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP)-derived iA\u03b2 to the critical threshold. This triggers the activation of the self-sustaining A\u03b2PP-independent iA\u03b2 production pathway and the commencement of the second, symptomatic AD stage. Importantly, A\u03b2 produced independently of A\u03b2PP is retained intraneuronally. It drives the AD pathology and perpetuates the operation of the pathway; continuous cycles of the iA\u03b2-stimulated propagation of its own A\u03b2PP-independent production constitute an engine that drives AD, the AD Engine. It appears that the dynamics of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2 accumulation is the determining factor that either drives Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline (AACD) and triggers AD or confers the resistance to both. Within the ACH2.0 framework, the ACH-based drugs, designed to lower levels of extracellular A\u03b2, could be applicable in the prevention of AD and treatment of AACD because they reduce the rate of accumulation of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2. The present study analyzes their utility and concludes that it is severely limited. Indeed, their short-term employment is ineffective, their long-term engagement is highly problematic, their implementation at the symptomatic stages of AD is futile, and their evaluation in conventional clinical trials for the prevention of AD is impractical at best, impossible at worst, and misleading in between. In contrast, the ACH2.0-guided Next Generation Therapeutic Strategy for the treatment and prevention of both AD and AACD, namely the depletion of iA\u03b2 via its transient, short-duration, targeted degradation by the novel ACH2.0-based drugs, has none of the shortcomings of the ACH-based drugs. It is potentially highly effective, easily evaluable in clinical trials, and opens up the possibility of once-in-a-lifetime-only therapeutic intervention for prevention and treatment of both conditions. It also identifies two plausible ACH2.0-based drugs: activators of physiologically occurring intra-iA\u03b2-cleaving capabilities of BACE1 and/or BACE2.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Biological Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Amyloid Status: An Illustration of Confirmation Bias in Medical Research?",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first characterized by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906 by studying a demented patient and discovering cerebral amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Subsequent research highlighted the roles of A\u03b2 peptides and tau proteins, which are the primary constituents of these lesions, which led to the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Technological advances, such as PET scans using Florbetapir, have made it possible to visualize amyloid plaques in living patients, thus improving AD's risk assessment. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association introduced biological diagnostic criteria in 2011, which underlined the amyloid deposits diagnostic value. However, potential confirmation bias may have led researchers to over-rely on amyloid markers independent of AD's symptoms, despite evidence of their limited specificity. This review provides a critical examination of the current research paradigm in AD, including, in particular, the predominant focus on amyloid and tau species in diagnostics. We discuss the potential multifaceted consequences of this approach and propose strategies to mitigate its overemphasis in the development of new biomarkers. Furthermore, our study presents comprehensive guidelines aimed at enhancing the creation of biomarkers for accurately predicting AD dementia onset. These innovations are crucial for refining patient selection processes in clinical trial enrollment and for the optimization of therapeutic strategies. Overcoming confirmation bias is essential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of AD and to move towards precision medicine by incorporating a more nuanced understanding of amyloid biomarkers.",

Our preliminary data show that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of everolimus (RAD001) soon after clinical onset greatly diminished cognitive impairment and the intracellular beta amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle load. However, RAD001 shows >90% degradation after 7 days in solution at body temperature, thus hampering the development of proper therapeutic regimens for patients. To overcome such a drawback, we developed a stable, liquid formulation of mTOR-Is by loading RAD001 into distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) micelles using the thin layer evaporation method. The formulation showed efficient encapsulation of RAD001 and a homogeneous colloidal size and stabilised RAD001, with over 95% of activity preserved after 14 days at 37 \u00b0C with a total decay only occurring after 98 days. RAD001-loaded DSPE-PEG2000 micelles were unchanged when stored at 4 and 25 \u00b0C over the time period investigated.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between baseline plasma concentration of Nfl and Mild Cognitive Impairment in participants who did and did not have a clinically determined diagnosis of dementia by the end of the three-year study. Additionally, we explored the connection between baseline plasma concentration of NfL and AD dementia patients, considering their demographics, clinical features, and cognitive profiles. A total of 350 participants from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk (BALTAZAR) multicenter prospective study were investigated: 161 AD dementia participants and 189 MCI participants (of which 141 had amnestic MCI and 48 non-amnestic MCI). Plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline and the progression of clinical and cognitive profiles was followed over the three years of follow-up. Baseline plasma NfL concentration increased across the Alzheimer's disease continuum with a mean NfL value of 17.1 ng/mL [SD = 6.1] in non-amnestic MCI, 20.7 ng/mL [SD = 12.0] in amnestic MCI, and 23.1 ng/mL [SD = 22.7] in AD dementia patients. Plasma NfL concentration correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), and global cognitive performance and decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE scores decreased in parallel with increasing plasma NfL concentration, independently of age and BMI. However, NfL concentration did not predict MCI participants' conversion to dementia within three years. Discussion: Baseline plasma NfL concentration is associated with cognitive status along the AD continuum, suggesting its usefulness as a potential informative biomarker for cognitive decline follow-up in patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the most common neurodegenerative disease. Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) is a pivotal factor in AD pathogenesis. Recent research has demonstrated that plant miRNAs exert cross-kingdom regulation on the target genes in animals. Gastrodia elata (G. elata) is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine that has significant pharmacological activity against diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Our previous studies have indicated that G. elata-specific miRNA plays a cross-kingdom regulatory role for the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in mice. In this study, further bioinformatics analysis suggested that Gas-miR36-5p targets GSK-3\u03b2. Through western blot, RT-qPCR, and assessments of T-AOC, SOD, and MDA levels, Gas-miR36-5p demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in an AD cell model. Furthermore, Gas-miR36-5p was detected in the murine brain tissues. The results of the Morris water maze test and western blot analysis provided positive evidence for reversing the learning deficits and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD mice, elucidating significant neuroprotective effects in an AD model following G. elata RNA administration. Our research emphasizes Gas-miR36-5p as a novel G. elata-specific miRNA with neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease by targeting GSK-3\u03b2. Consequently, our findings provide valuable insights into the cross-kingdom regulatory mechanisms underlying G. elata-specific miRNA, presenting a novel perspective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Although current Alzheimer's disease treatments can alleviate symptoms, they cannot prevent the disease from progressing. To accurately diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease, it is therefore necessary to establish effective methods for diagnosis. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the most frequent genetic risk factor for AD, is expressed in more than half of patients with AD, making it an attractive target for AD therapy. We used molecular docking simulations, classical molecular mechanics optimizations, and ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations to investigate the specific interactions between ApoE4 and the naturally occurring compounds found in the plant Moringa Oleifera. According to the FMO calculations, quercetin had the highest binding affinity to ApoE4 among the sixteen compounds because its hydroxyl groups generated strong hydrogen bonds with the ApoE4 residues Trp11, Asp12, Arg15, and Asp130. As a result, we proposed various quercetin derivatives by introducing a hydroxyl group into quercetin and studied their ApoE4 binding properties. The FMO data clearly showed that adding a hydroxyl group to quercetin improved its binding capacity to ApoE4. Furthermore, ApoE4 Trp11, Asp12, Arg15, and Asp130 residues were discovered to be required for significant interactions between ApoE4 and quercetin derivatives. They had a higher ApoE4 binding affinity than our previously proposed epicatechin derivatives. Accordingly, the current results evaluated using the ab initio FMO method will be useful for designing potent ApoE4 inhibitors that can be used as a candidate agent for AD treatment.",

Palmatine, one of the main components of Huangteng, the rattan stem of Fibraurea recisa Pierre (Menispermaceae), has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of palmatine on amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells and AD mice and to investigate its mechanism of action. CCK8 assays, ELISA, the Morris water maze assay, fluorescent probes, calcein/PI staining, immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used. The experimental results show that palmatine can increase the survival rate of A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cells and mouse hippocampal neurons, reduce apoptosis, reduce the content of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, GSH, SOD, MDA and ROS, improve the learning and memory ability of AD mice, inhibit the expression of Keap-1 and Bax, and promote the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bcl-2. We conclude that palmatine can ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation produced by A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cells and mice by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

In this pilot study, the potential of Electrovestibulography (EVestG) for identifying AD, AD-CVD, and healthy control populations was investigated. Materials and Methods: A novel hierarchical multiclass diagnostic algorithm based on the outcomes of its lower levels of binary classifications was developed using data of 16 patients with AD, 13 with AD-CVD, and 24 healthy age-matched controls, and then evaluated on a blind testing dataset made up of a new population of 12 patients diagnosed with AD, 9 with AD-CVD, and 8 healthy controls.

Results: The accuracies of the multiclass diagnostic algorithm were found to be 85.7% and 79.6% for the training and blind testing datasets, respectively. While a statistically significant difference was found between the populations after accounting for sex and age, no significant effect was found for sex or age covariates.

Conclusions: Two EVestG movements (stimuli) and their most informative features that are best selective of the above-populations' separations were identified, and a hierarchy diagnostic algorithm was developed for three-way classification. Given that the two stimuli predominantly stimulate the otholithic organs, physiological and experimental evidence supportive of the results are presented.

Frailty is an independent syndrome that involves increased multidimensional age-related deficits, heightens vulnerability to stressors, and involves physical deficits in mainly the locomotor/muscular capacity, but also in physical appearance and cognition. For sporadic Alzheimer's disease, age per se is one of the most relevant risk factors, but frailty has also been associated with this disease. Therefore, we aimed to answer the two following questions within a cross-sectional study: (1) do Alzheimer's model mice show increased frailty, and (2) what changes of the microbiota occur concerning chronological age or frailty? Indeed, aged 5xFAD mice showed increased frailty compared to wild type littermates. In addition, 5xFAD mice had significantly lower quantities of Bacteroides spp. when only considering frailty, and lower levels of Bacteroidetes in terms of both frailty and chronological age compared to their wild type littermates.

However, the application of probiotics ignores that the intestine is a complete microecosystem with competition among microorganisms. FMT also has issues when applied to patient treatment.

In this article, we confirmed that the treatment of intestinal dominant microbiota significantly restored intestinal microbiota abundance and composition to normal levels in APP/PS1 mice; downregulated brain tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression levels; and reduced the area of A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the brain hippocampus.

The underlying causes include the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) in the brain, abnormal phosphorylation, and aggregation of tau protein within nerve cells, as well as neuronal damage and death. Currently, there is no cure for AD with drug therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise have been widely used to treat AD, but the specific molecular and biological mechanisms are not well understood. In this narrative review, we integrate the biology of AD and summarize the knowledge of the molecular, neural, and physiological mechanisms underlying exercise-induced improvements in AD progression. We discuss various exercise interventions used in AD and show that exercise directly or indirectly affects the brain by regulating crosstalk mechanisms between peripheral organs and the brain, including \"bone-brain crosstalk\", \"muscle-brain crosstalk\", and \"gut-brain crosstalk\". We also summarize the potential role of artificial intelligence and neuroimaging technologies in exercise interventions for AD. We emphasize that moderate-intensity, regular, long-term exercise may improve the progression of Alzheimer's disease through various molecular and biological pathways, with multimodal exercise providing greater benefits.

        "AbstractText": "Not only gray matter lesions (GMLs) but also white matter lesions (WMLs) can play important roles in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The progression of cognitive impairment (CI) and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) might be caused by a concerted effect of both GML and WML. This study aimed to investigate the association between GML and WML and how they are involved in the symptoms of CI and BPSD in dementia patients by means of imaging technology. Patients in our memory clinic, who were diagnosed with AD-type dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and had undergone both single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and brain MRI, were consecutively enrolled (n = 156; 61 males and 95 females; 79.8 \u00b1 7.4 years old). Symptoms of CI and BPSD were obtained from patients' medical records. For the analysis of GMLs and WMLs, SPECT data and MRI T1-weighted images were used, respectively. This study followed the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the institutional ethics committee. According to a multivariate analysis, disorientation and disturbed attention demonstrated a relationship between the precuneus and WMLs in both hemispheres. Hyperactivity in BPSD showed multiple correlations between GMLs on both sides of the frontal cortex and WMLs. Patients with aMCI presented more multiple correlations between GMLs and WMLs compared with those with AD-type dementia regarding dementia symptoms including BPSD. The interaction between GMLs and WMLs may vary depending on the symptoms of CI and BPSD. Hyperactivity in BPSD may be affected by the functional relationship between GMLs and WMLs in the left and right hemispheres. The correlation between GMLs and WMLs may be changing in AD-type dementia and aMCI.",

        "AbstractText": "The rate of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) is rising rapidly as the world's population ages. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia are becoming more prevalent and are now the fourth leading cause of death, following heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Although modern diagnostic techniques for detecting NDDs are varied, scientists are continuously seeking new and improved methods to enable early and precise detection. In addition to that, the present treatment options are limited to symptomatic therapy, which is effective in reducing the progression of neurodegeneration but lacks the ability to target the root cause-progressive loss of neuronal functioning. As a result, medical researchers continue to explore new treatments for these conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of the key features of NDDs and an overview of the underlying mechanisms of neuroimmune dysfunction. Additionally, we dive into the cutting-edge treatment options that gene therapy provides in the quest to treat these disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Agitation is one of the most eminent characteristics of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affecting people living with Alzheimer's and Dementia and has serious consequences for patients and caregivers. The current consensus is that agitation results, in part, from the disruption of ascending monoamine regulators of cortical circuits, especially the loss of serotonergic activity. It is believed that the first line of treatment for these conditions is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but these are effective in only about 40% of patients. Person-specific biomarkers, for example, ones based on in vitro iPSC-derived models of serotonin activity, which predict who with Agitation responds to an SSRI, are a major clinical priority. Here, we report the generation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a 74-year-old AD patient, the homozygous APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 carrier, who developed Agitation. His iPSCs were reprogrammed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the transient expression of pluripotency genes. These display typical iPSC characteristics that are karyotypically normal and attain the capacity to differentiate into three germ layers. The newly patient-derived iPSC line offers a unique resource to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric symptom progression in AD.",

However, the high dimensionality of microarray datasets and small sample sizes pose challenges. Gene selection techniques have emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, potentially revolutionizing AD diagnosis. The study aims to investigate deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, in predicting Alzheimer's disease using microarray gene expression data. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model for early detection and diagnosis, potentially improving patient care and intervention strategies. This study employed gene selection techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to pinpoint pertinent genes within microarray datasets. Leveraging deep learning principles, we harnessed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as our classifier for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction. Our approach involved the utilization of a seven-layer CNN with diverse configurations to process the dataset. Empirical outcomes on the AD dataset underscored the effectiveness of the PCA-CNN model, yielding an accuracy of 96.60% and a loss of 0.3503. Likewise, the SVD-CNN model showcased remarkable accuracy, attaining 97.08% and a loss of 0.2466. These results accentuate the potential of our method for gene dimension reduction and classification accuracy enhancement by selecting a subset of pertinent genes. Integrating gene selection methodologies with deep learning architectures presents a promising framework for elevating AD prediction and promoting precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders. Ongoing research endeavors aim to generalize this approach for diverse applications, explore alternative gene selection techniques, and investigate a variety of deep learning architectures.",

        "AbstractText": "In the early stages of Alzheimer-Perusini's disease (AD), individuals often experience vision-related issues such as color vision impairment, reduced contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity problems. As the disease progresses, there is a connection with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading to retinal cell death. The retina's involvement suggests a link with the hippocampus, where most AD forms start. A thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) due to the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is seen as a potential AD diagnostic marker using electroretinography (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Amyloid beta fragments (A\u03b2), found in the eye's vitreous and aqueous humor, are also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and accumulate in the retina. A\u03b2 is known to cause tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to its buildup in various retinal layers. However, diseases like AD are now seen as mixed proteinopathies, with deposits of the prion protein (PrP) and \u03b1-synuclein found in affected brains and retinas. Glial cells, especially microglial cells, play a crucial role in these diseases, maintaining immunoproteostasis. Studies have shown similarities between retinal and brain microglia in terms of transcription factor expression and morphotypes. All these findings constitute a good start to achieving better comprehension of neurodegeneration in both the eye and the brain. New insights will be able to bring the scientific community closer to specific disease-modifying therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "The overweight status or obesity can be confirmed through classical methods such as the body mass index (BMI) and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Apart from metabolic issues such as atherosclerosis, liver steatosis, or diabetes mellitus, long-term obesity or overweight status can pose a risk for cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. While some acute adverse events like coronary syndromes of strokes are well-documented to be linked to an increased body mass, there are also chronic processes that, due to their silent onset and evolution, are underdiagnosed and not as thoroughly studied. Through this review, we aimed to collect all relevant data with regard to the long-term impact of obesity on cognitive function in all ages and its correlation with an earlier onset of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact mechanisms through which a decline in cognitive functions occurs in overweight or obese persons are still being discussed. A combination of factors has been acknowledged as potential triggers, such as a sedentary lifestyle and stress, as well as a genetic predisposition, for example, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles in AD. Most research highlights the impact of vascular dysfunction and systemic inflammation on the nervous system in patients with obesity and the subsequent neurological changes. Obesity during the early to mid-ages leads to an earlier onset of cognitive dysfunction in various forms. Also, lifestyle intervention can reverse cognitive dysfunction, especially dieting, to encourage weight loss.",

Tau and A\u03b2 complexes spread from the entorhinal cortex of the brain to interconnected regions, where they bind pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia to trigger inflammation and neurotoxicity that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration and clinical AD. Systemic inflammation is initiated by A\u03b2's egress into the circulation, which may be secondary to microglial activation and can confer both destructive and reparative actions. Microglial activation pathways and downstream drivers of A\u03b2/NFT neurotoxicity, including inflammatory regulators, are primary targets for AD therapy. Osteopontin (OPN), an inflammatory cytokine and biomarker of AD, is implicated in A\u03b2 clearance and toxicity, microglial activation, and inflammation, and is considered to be a potential therapeutic target. Here, using the most relevant works from the literature, we review and contextualize the evidence for a central role of OPN and associated inflammation in AD.",

Recent studies have illuminated the pathophysiology of gout/hyperuricemia and its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and complications. The genetic involvement of urate transporters and enzymes is also proven. URAT1, a molecular therapeutic target for gout/hyperuricemia, was initially derived from research into hereditary renal hypouricemia (RHUC). RHUC is often accompanied by complications such as exercise-induced acute kidney injury, which indicates the key physiological role of uric acid. Several studies have also revealed its physiological role as both an anti-oxidant and a pro-oxidant, acting as both a scavenger and a generator of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These discoveries have prompted research interest in SU and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme that produces both urate and ROSs, as status or progression biomarkers of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The notion of \"the lower, the better\" is therefore incorrect; a better understanding of uric acid handling and metabolism/transport comes from an awareness that excessively high and low levels both cause problems. We summarize here the current body of evidence, demonstrate that uric acid is much more than a metabolic waste product, and finally propose the novel disease concept of \"dysuricemia\" on the path toward \"normouricemia\", or optimal SU level, to take advantage of the dual roles of uric acid. Our proposal should help to interpret the spectrum from hypouricemia to hyperuricemia/gout as a single disease category.",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the neuropathological and clinical features of CTE, proposed biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both research and clinical settings, and a range of treatments based on previous preclinical and clinical research studies. Due to the heterogeneity of TBI, there is no universally agreed-upon serum, CSF, or neuroimaging marker for its diagnosis. However, as our understanding of this complex disease continues to evolve, it is likely that there will be more robust, early diagnostic methods and effective clinical treatments.

Significant associations between the TMS-3 condition and A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau were observed for the whole sample. In addition, the CSF- participants obtained higher cognitive performance in TMS-3 compared to the CSF+ group.

Therefore, changing attitudes and beliefs about exercise is key to increasing motivation for physical activity especially in middle-age adults with DS. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) on self-efficacy and exercise perception in middle-age adults with Down syndrome (DS) following an exercise intervention three times a week for 8 weeks. Twelve participants were in the ACT group in which a motor assisted their cycling to be performed at least 30% faster than voluntary cycling (VC), 10 participants were in the voluntary cycling group, and two participants were in the no cycling (NC) group. The results showed that both exercise groups (i.e., ACT and VC) improved in their self-efficacy after the 8-week intervention. In addition, exercise perception improved following ACT, but not VC or NC. Our results are discussed with respect to their future implications for exercise in the DS population. The results can be attributed to differences in effort required by each intervention group as well as the neurotrophic factors that occur when muscle contractions create synaptic connections resulting in improvement in cognition and feelings of satisfaction.",

We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020. Searches were performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, in May-September 2023. Two authors independently reviewed the human studies with the following tools: (1) revised Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias for randomized trials 2.0; (2) the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions.

Co-exposure to arsenic and alcohol can occur because an individual with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is exposed to arsenic in their drinking water or food or because of arsenic found directly in alcoholic beverages. This study aims to determine if co-exposure to alcohol and arsenic leads to worse outcomes in neurodegeneration and associated mechanisms that could lead to cell death. To study this, mice were exposed to a 10-day gavage model of alcohol-induced neurodegeneration with varying doses of arsenic (0, 0.005, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg). The following were examined after the last dose of ethanol: (1) microglia activation assessed via immunohistochemical detection of Iba-1, (2) reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) using a colorimetric assay, (3) neurodegeneration using Fluoro-Jade\u00ae C staining (FJC), and 4) arsenic absorption using ICP-MS. After exposure, there was an additive effect of the highest dose of arsenic (10 mg/kg) in the dentate gyrus of alcohol-induced FJC+ cells. This additional cell loss may have been due to the observed increase in microglial reactivity or increased arsenic absorption following co-exposure to ethanol and arsenic. The data also showed that arsenic caused an increase in CYP2E1 expression and ROS/RNS production in the hippocampus which could have independently contributed to increased neurodegeneration. Altogether, these findings suggest a potential cyclical impact of co-exposure to arsenic and ethanol as ethanol increases arsenic absorption but arsenic also enhances alcohol's deleterious effects in the CNS.",

These processes are based on the separation of biopolymers into phases regulated by multiple specific and nonspecific inter- and intramolecular interactions. Among the realm of MLOs, a special place is taken by the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs or PML bodies), which are the intranuclear compartments involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism, transcription, the maintenance of genome stability, responses to viral infection, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. According to the accepted models, specific interactions, such as SUMO/SIM, the formation of disulfide bonds, etc., play a decisive role in the biogenesis of PML bodies. In this work, a number of bioinformatics approaches were used to study proteins found in the proteome of PML bodies for their tendency for spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is usually caused by weak nonspecific interactions. A total of 205 proteins found in PML bodies have been identified. It has been suggested that UBC9, P53, HIPK2, and SUMO1 can be considered as the scaffold proteins of PML bodies. It was shown that more than half of the proteins in the analyzed proteome are capable of spontaneous LLPS, with 85% of the analyzed proteins being intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and the remaining 15% being proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). About 44% of all proteins analyzed in this study contain SUMO binding sites and can potentially be SUMOylated.

        "AbstractText": "Mitochondria play a key role in cellular functions, including energy production and oxidative stress regulation. For this reason, maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis (homeostasis of the proteome) is essential for cellular health. Therefore, there are different mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), mitophagy, or mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). The last item is a stress response that occurs when stress is present within mitochondria and, especially, when the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix surpasses the folding capacity of the mitochondrion. In response to this, molecular chaperones and proteases as well as the mitochondrial antioxidant system are activated to restore mitochondrial proteostasis and cellular function. In disease contexts, mtUPR modulation holds therapeutic potential by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. In particular, in the case of neurodegenerative diseases, such as primary mitochondrial diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), there is a wealth of evidence demonstrating that the modulation of mtUPR helps to reduce neurodegeneration and its associated symptoms in various cellular and animal models.

        "AbstractText": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are important in regulating sympathetic tone and cardiovascular function in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases might be the risk factors for developing AD. The present study examines the acute effects of soluble A\u03b2 on the function of NMDA receptors in rats RVLM. We used the magnitude of increases in the blood pressure (pressor responses) induced by microinjection of NMDA into the RVLM as an index of NMDA receptor function in the RVLM. Soluble A\u03b2 was applied by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. A\u03b21-40 at a lower dose (0.2 nmol) caused a slight reduction, and a higher dose (2 nmol) showed a significant decrease in NMDA-induced pressor responses 10 min after administration. ICV injection of A\u03b21-42 (2 nmol) did not affect NMDA-induced pressor responses in the RVLM. Co-administration of A\u03b21-40 with ifenprodil or memantine blocked the inhibitory effects of A\u03b21-40. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase in the immunoreactivity of phosphoserine 1480 of GluN2B subunits (pGluN2B-serine1480) in the neuron of the RVLM without significant changes in phosphoserine 896 of GluN1 subunits (pGluN1-serine896), GluN1 and GluN2B, 10 min following A\u03b21-40 administration compared with saline. Interestingly, we found a much higher level of A\u03b21-40 compared to that of A\u03b21-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 10 min following ICV administration of the same dose (2 nmol) of the peptides. In conclusion, the results suggest that ICV A\u03b21-40, but not A\u03b21-42, produced an inhibitory effect on NMDA receptor function in the RVLM, which might result from changes in pGluN2B-serine1480 (regulated by casein kinase II). The different elimination of the peptides in the CSF might contribute to the differential effects of A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 on NMDA receptor function.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as the primary and most common cause of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly population worldwide. Chemical analyses of B. pendula leaf extract (BPE), performed using spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods (LC/MS), revealed high amounts of polyphenol carboxylic acids (gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, trans-p-coumaric, ferulic, and salicylic acids), as well as flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, naringenin, hyperoside, quercetin, and quercitrin). Four groups of Wistar rats were used in this experiment (n = 7/group): control (untreated), A\u03b21-42 (2 \u03bcg/rat intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), A\u03b21-42 + BPE (200 mg/Kg b.w.), and DMSO (10 \u03bcL/rat). On the first day, one dose of A\u03b21-42 was intracerebroventricularly administered to animals in groups 2 and 3. Subsequently, BPE was orally administered for the next 15 days to group 3. On the 16th day, behavioral tests were performed. Biomarkers of brain oxidative stress Malondialdehyde (MDA), (Peroxidase (PRx), Catalase (CAT), and Superoxid dismutase (SOD) and inflammation (cytokines: tumor necrosis factor -\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2)) in plasma and hippocampus homogenates were assessed. Various protein expressions (Phospho-Tau (Ser404) (pTau Ser 404), Phospho-Tau (Ser396) (pTau Ser 396), synaptophysin, and the Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathway) were analyzed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. The results show that BPE diminished lipid peroxidation and neuroinflammation, modulated specific protein expression, enhanced the antioxidant capacity, and improved spontaneous alternation behavior, suggesting that it has beneficial effects in AD.",

The gut microbiome becomes increasingly perturbed with aging so the use of probiotics can be a strategy for maintaining a balanced gut microbiome. A previous report showed that Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BPL1\u2122 induces through its lipoteichoic acid (LTA) fat reduction activities via the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Here, we have delved into the mechanism of action, eliminating alternative pathways as putative mechanisms. Furthermore, we have identified that BPL1\u2122, its heat treated form (BPL1\u2122 HT) and its LTA prolong longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in an insulin/IGF-1-dependent mechanism, and its consumption improves the oxidative stress response, gut permeability and protection against pathogenic infections. Furthermore, positive effects on C. elegans stress-related behaviors and in the Alzheimer's Disease model were found, highlighting the potential of the strain in improving the cognitive functions and proteotoxicity in the nematode. These results indicate the pivotal role of the IGF-1 pathway in the activity of the strain and pave the way for potential applications of BPL1\u2122, BPL1\u2122 HT and its LTA in the field of longevity and age-related markers.",

In the present study, a unique combination of \u03b1-lipoic acid, citicoline, extracts of leaves from olive tree and green tea, vitamin D3, selenium and an immune-supporting complex was tested in scopolamine-induced dementia in rats. Using behavioral and biochemical methods, we assessed the effects of the combination on learning and memory, and elucidated the mechanisms of these effects. Our results showed that, compared to its components, the experimental combination was most efficient in improving short- and long-term memory as assessed by the step-through method as well as spatial memory as assessed by T-maze and Barnes maze underlined by decreases in AChE activity (p < 0.05) and LPO (p < 0.001), increases in SOD activity in the cortex (p < 0.05) and increases in catalase (p < 0.05) and GPx (p < 0.01) activities and BDNF (p < 0.001) and pCREB (p < 0.05) levels in the hippocampus.

The most common NDs are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, in which cholinergic and dopaminergic systems are impaired, respectively. Despite different brain regions being affected, oxidative stress and inflammation were found to be common triggers in the pathogenesis and progression of both diseases. By taking advantage of a multi-target approach, in this work we explored alkyl substituted coumarins as neuroprotective agents, capable to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting enzymes involved in neurodegeneration, among which are Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs), Monoamine Oxidases (MAOs), and Cholinesterases (ChEs). The compounds were synthesized and profiled against the three targeted enzymes. The binding mode of the most promising compounds (7 and 9) within MAO-A and -B was analyzed through molecular modeling studies, providing and explanation for the different selectivities observed for the MAO isoforms. In vitro biological studies using LPS-stimulated rat astrocytes showed that some compounds were able to counteract the oxidative stress-induced neuroinflammation and hamper interleukin-6 secretion, confirming the success of this multitarget approach.",

However, the genetic basis underlying the cortical atrophy remains poorly defined. Herein, we aim to illustrate the effect of the Wnt target genes on the cortical volumes of AD patients. 82 sporadic AD patients were recruited. All the subjects had history survey, blood biochemical examination, cognitive assessment, MRI morphometry and whole exome sequencing. This report focused on 84 common variants (minor allele frequency\u2009>\u20090.01) of 32 Wnt target genes, including the APC, DAAM1, DACT1, DISC1, LATS2, TLR2, WDR61, and the AXIN, DVL, FZD, LRP, TCF/LEF, WNT family genes. The Wnt target genes showed asymmetric effects on the cortical volumes of AD patients. The right temporal/parietal/occipital cortices were more affected than left temporal/parietal/occipital cortices. Nevertheless, the reverse applied to the frontal cortex. The DACT1 affected the cortical thickness most, followed by the TCF3 and APC. The DACT1 rs698025-GG genotype displayed greater right temporal pole and left medial orbito-frontal gyrus than rs698025-GA genotype (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs. 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6, P\u2009=\u20090.005; 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

        "AbstractText": "With the aging of the population, treatment of conditions emerging in old age, such as neurodegenerative disorders, has become a major medical challenge. Of these, Alzheimer's disease, leading to cognitive dysfunction, is of particular interest. Neuronal loss plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this condition, and over the years, a great effort has been made to determine the role of various factors in this process. Unfortunately, until now, the exact pathomechanism of this condition remains unknown. However, the most popular theories associate AD with abnormalities in the Tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) proteins, which lead to their deposition and result in neuronal death. Neurons, like all cells, die in a variety of ways, among which pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are associated with the activation of various caspases. It is worth mentioning that Tau and A\u03b2 proteins are considered to be one of the caspase activators, leading to cell death. Moreover, the protease activity of caspases influences both of the previously mentioned proteins, Tau and A\u03b2, converting them into more toxic derivatives. Due to the variety of ways caspases impact the development of AD, drugs targeting caspases could potentially be useful in the treatment of this condition. Therefore, there is a constant need to search for novel caspase inhibitors and evaluate them in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Using ABCA7 knockout human iPSC models generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we investigated the impacts of ABCA7 deficiency on neuronal metabolism and function. Lipidomics revealed that mitochondria-related phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were reduced in the ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived cortical organoids. Consistently, ABCA7 deficiency-induced alterations of mitochondrial morphology accompanied by reduced ATP synthase activity and exacerbated oxidative damage in the organoids. Furthermore, ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived neurons showed compromised mitochondrial respiration and excess ROS generation, as well as enlarged mitochondrial morphology compared to the isogenic controls. ABCA7 deficiency also decreased spontaneous synaptic firing and network formation in iPSC-derived neurons, in which the effects were rescued by supplementation with phosphatidylglycerol or NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide. Importantly, effects of ABCA7 deficiency on mitochondria morphology and synapses were recapitulated in synaptosomes isolated from the brain of neuron-specific Abca7 knockout mice. Together, our results provide evidence that ABCA7 loss-of-function contributes to AD risk by modulating mitochondria lipid metabolism.",

Lately, the emerging role of post-translational modifications (PTMs), in the context of cell cycle regulators, has garnered big interest as a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. The review explores the problematic panorama of PTMs on cell cycle regulators and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases. We delve into the dynamic phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, Glycation, and Neddylation that modulate the key cell cycle regulators, consisting of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their inhibitors. The dysregulation of these PTMs is related to aberrant cell cycle in neurons, which is one of the factors involved in neurodegenerative pathologies. Moreover, the effect of exogenous activation of CDKs and CDK inhibitors through PTMs on the signaling cascade was studied in postmitotic conditions of NDDs. Furthermore, the therapeutic implications of CDK inhibitors and associated alteration in PTMs were discussed. Lastly, we explored the putative mechanism of PTMs to restore normal neuronal function that might reverse NDDs.",

Among 190 patients with PSP who were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group at Mayo Clinic during 2009-2023, we identified two patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and harbor novel MAPT mutations. To better investigate the potential effects of these mutations, we compared the clinical, and neuroimaging characteristics of these two patients to 20 randomly selected patients with PSP-RS without a MAPT mutation.

However, transitioning to the community after discharge from home health presents challenges to patient safety and quality of life. The severity of an individual's functional impairments, cognitive limitations, and behavioral and psychological symptoms may compound these challenges. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between dementia severity and successful discharge to community (DTC) from home health. This was a retrospective study of 142 376 Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. Successful DTC was defined as having no unplanned hospitalization or death within 30 days of DTC from home health. Successful DTC rates were calculated, and multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of successful DTC, by dementia severity category, adjusted for patient and clinical characteristics. Six dementia severity categories were identified using a crosswalk between items on the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and the Functional Assessment Staging Tool. Successful DTC occurred in 71.2% of beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in the 2 most severe dementia categories had significantly lower risk of successful DTC (category 6: RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.889-0.910; category 7: RR = 0.737, 95% CI = 0.704-0.770) than those in the least severe dementia category. The RR of successful DTC for people with ADRD decreased as the level of independence with oral medication management decreased and when there was an overall greater need for caregiver assistance. Patient status at the time of admission to home health is associated with outcomes after discharge from home health. Early identification of people in advanced stages of ADRD provides an opportunity to implement strategies to facilitate successful DTC while people are still receiving home care services. The severity of ADRD and availability of caregiver assistance should be key considerations in planning for successful DTC for people with ADRD.",

The investigation of the involvement of cerebral small veins in the advancement of AD has yet to be sufficiently explored in previous studies, primarily due to constraints associated with pathological staining techniques. However, recent research has provided valuable insights into multiple pathophysiological occurrences concerning cerebral small veins in AD, which may manifest sequentially, concurrently, or in a self-perpetuating manner. These events are presumed to be among the initial processes in the disease's progression. The impact of cerebral small vein loss on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) clearance through the glial lymphatic system is noteworthy. There exists a potential interdependence between collagen deposition and A\u03b2 deposition in cerebral small veins. The compromised functionality of cerebral small veins can result in decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, potentially leading to cerebral tissue ischemia and edema. Additionally, the reduction of cerebral small veins may facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory factors into the brain parenchyma, thereby eliciting neuroinflammatory responses. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a valuable modality for the efficient assessment of cerebral small veins, precisely the deep medullary vein (DMV), and holds promise for the identification of precise and reliable imaging biomarkers for AD. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current advancements and obstacles to the impairment of cerebral small veins in AD.

We have investigated the binding properties of SMBT-1, l-deprenyl, and BU99008 in AD and cognitively normal control (CN) brains. Competition binding assays with [3H]-l-deprenyl and [3H]-BU99008 versus unlabeled SMBT-1 in postmortem AD and CN temporal and frontal cortex brains demonstrated that SMBT-1 interacted with [3H]-deprenyl at a single binding site (nM range) and with [3H]-BU99008 at multiple binding sites (from nM to \u03bcM). Autoradiography studies on large frozen postmortem AD and CN hemisphere brain sections demonstrated that 1 \u03bcM SMBT-1 almost completely displaced the [3H]-l-deprenyl binding (>90%), while SMBT-1 only partly displaced the [3H]-BU99008 binding (50-60% displacement) in cortical regions. In conclusion, SMBT-1, l-deprenyl, and BU99008 interact at the same MAO-B binding site, while BU99008 shows an additional independent binding site in AD and CN brains. The high translational power of our studies in human AD and CN brains suggests that the multitracer approach with SMBT-1, l-deprenyl, and BU99008 could be useful for imaging reactive astrogliosis.",

        "AbstractText": "The mammalian central nervous system consists of a large number of cells, which contain not only different types of neurons, but also a large number of glial cells, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. These cells are capable of performing highly refined electrophysiological activities and providing the brain with functions such as nutritional support, information transmission and pathogen defense. The diversity of cell types and individual differences between cells have brought inspiration to the study of the mechanism of central nervous system diseases. In order to explore the role of different cells, a new technology, single-cell sequencing technology has emerged to perform specific analysis of high-throughput cell populations, and has been continuously developed. Single-cell sequencing technology can accurately analyze single-cell expression in mixed-cell populations and collect cells from different spatial locations, time stages and types. By using single-cell sequencing technology to compare gene expression profiles of normal and diseased cells, it is possible to discover cell subsets associated with specific diseases and their associated genes. Therefore, scientists can understand the development process, related functions and disease state of the nervous system from an unprecedented depth. In conclusion, single-cell sequencing technology provides a powerful technology for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for central nervous system diseases.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Loss of TDP-43 splicing repression occurs early in the aging population and is associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes and cognitive decline.",
        "AbstractText": "LATE-NC, the neuropathologic changes of limbic-predominant age-related TAR DNA-binding protein 43\u00a0kDa (TDP-43) encephalopathy are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive impairment in older adults. The association of TDP-43 proteinopathy with AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and its impact on specific cognitive domains are not fully understood and whether loss of TDP-43 function occurs early in the aging brain remains unknown. Here, using a large set of autopsies from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and another younger cohort, we were able to study brains from subjects 21-109\u00a0years of age. Examination of these brains show that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression, as judged by TDP-43 nuclear clearance and expression of a cryptic exon in HDGFL2, first occurs during the 6th decade, preceding by a decade the appearance of TDP-43+\u2009neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs). We corroborated this observation using a monoclonal antibody to demonstrate a cryptic exon-encoded neoepitope within HDGFL2 in neurons exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. TDP-43 nuclear clearance is associated with increased burden of tau pathology. Age at death, female sex, high CERAD neuritic plaque score, and high Braak neurofibrillary stage significantly increase the odds of LATE-NC. Faster rates of cognitive decline on verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test immediate recall), visuospatial ability (Card Rotations Test), mental status (MMSE) and semantic fluency (Category Fluency Test) were associated with LATE-NC. Notably, the effects of LATE-NC on verbal memory and visuospatial ability are independent of ADNC. However, the effects of TDP-43 nuclear clearance in absence of NCI on the longitudinal trajectories and levels of cognitive measures are not significant. These results establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression is an early event occurring in the aging population during the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy and is associated with increased tau pathology. Furthermore, LATE-NC correlates with high levels of ADNC but also has an impact on specific memory and visuospatial functions in aging that is independent of AD.",

MCI represents a transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and more severe cognitive decline, which appears in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies have shown that tDCS can have several useful effects in patients with MCI. It is believed to enhance cognitive functions, including memory and attention, potentially slowing down the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. tDCS is believed to work by modulating neuronal activity and promoting synaptic plasticity in the brain regions associated with cognition. Moreover, tDCS is generally considered safe and well-tolerated, making it an attractive option for long-term therapeutic use in MCI. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal stimulation parameters and long-term effects of tDCS in this population, as well as its potential to serve as a complementary therapy alongside other interventions for MCI. In this review, we included 16 randomized clinical trials containing patients with MCI who were treated with tDCS. We aim to provide important evidence for the cognitive enhancement using tDCS in patients with MCI, summarizing the effects and conclusions found in several clinical trials, and discuss its main mechanisms.",

        "AbstractText": "Huperzine A (HupA) is an important drug for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is primarily extracted from the Huperzia serrata (Lycopodiaceae). Failures in the chemical synthesis of Hup and in vitro culture have put H. serrata in danger of extinction, and there is a need for an extensive investigation of Hup from alternative perspectives. The aim of this study is to identify endophytic fungi that produce high Hup or simultaneously produce many types of Hup and have high genetic stability derived from other Lycopodiaceae species as a source of materials for natural Hup production. In this work, Hup-producing endophytic fungi were isolated from three species: Lycopodium clavatum, Phlegmariurus squarrosus, and P. phlegmaria. Of these, L. clavatum and P. squarrosus were confirmed as novel sources of Hup-producing fungi. Based on morphological characteristics and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS sequences, four endophytic fungi Colletotrichum siamense THG1-17, Epicoccum sorghinum THG01-18, Phoma sp. TKH3-2, and Phyllosticta sp. THG2-27 were firstly isolated from these Lycopodiaceae plants, which were capable of simultaneously producing both HupA and HupB, as evidenced by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The four strains showed stability in Hup yield over 50 generations of culture with an in vitro storage period of 3 months. These isolated fungi will provide a new source of materials for further research to develop drugs containing HupA as well as HupB for AD treatment in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "Surface engineering of nanoparticles has been widely used in biosensing and assays, where sensitivity was mainly limited by plasmonic colour change or electrochemical responses. Here, we report a novel biomimetic sensing strategy involving protein-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), where the modulation strategy was inspired by gastropods in inhibition of coffee-ring effects in their trail-followings. The so-called coffee-ring effect presents the molecular behaviour of AuNPs to a macroscopic ring through aggregation, and thus greatly improves sensitivity. The assay relies upon the different assembly patterns of AuNPs against analytes, resulting in the formation or suppression of coffee-ring effects by the different surface engineering of AuNPs by proteins and peptides. The mechanism of the coffee-ring formation process is examined through experimental characterizations and computational simulations. A practical coffee-ring effect assay is developed for a proof-of-concept target, amyloid \u03b2 (1-42), which is a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. A novel quasi-titrimetric protocol is constructed for quantitative determination of the target molecule. The assay shows excellent selectivity and sensitivity for the amyloid \u03b2 monomer, with a low detection limit of 20 pM. Combined with a fluorescent staining technique, the assay is designed as a smart sensor for amyloid \u03b2 detection and fibrillation evaluation in rat cerebrospinal fluids, which is a potential point-of-care test for Alzheimer's disease. Connections between amyloid fibrillation and different courses of brain ischaemia are also studied, with improved sensitivity, lower sample volumes that are required, convenience for rapid detection, and point-of-care testing.",

        "AbstractText": "We had attended a Parkinson's Disease (PD) patient for a non-healing wound who reported a marked decrease in his hand tremor and freezing of gait when his wound was exposed to a ceramic far-field infrared (cFIR) blanket. PD is the most frequent motor disorder and the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) affect up to 10 million people throughout the world, and the major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of PD is the accumulation and propagation of pathological \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and the death of dopaminergic cells in the Nigrostriatal system. Efforts to slow or stop its spreading have resulted in the development and use of dopaminergic drug replacement therapy. Unfortunately, there is a loss of about 70-80% of substantia nigral dopaminergic neurons in patients by the time they are diagnosed with PD, and various dopaminergic drugs provide only temporary relief of their motor symptoms. There are limitations in treating PD with many conventional medications, necessitating a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmacological therapy as an essential adjunct to better address the health and welfare of PD patients. We used male adult A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to a ceramic far-infrared blanket. Motor activity was assessed using the rotarod apparatus, and mouse brains were examined to quantify the fluorescence intensities of the immunostained samples. A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice had a significantly shorter time stay on the rotating bar than the wild-type mice (B6C3H). The rotarod performance was significantly improved in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to cFIR as well as B6C3H healthy wild mice exposed to cFIR. There was a significant statistical and substantive increase in the cellular composition of the Striatum and substantia nigra of cFIR-treated mice. Improvement in motor performance is seen in PD mice and wild mice and is associated with increases in cell volume in the substantia nigra and striatum after treatment.",

The resulting proteins, AChE, MAO-A, MAO-B, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase, were studied by molecular docking, resulting in the finding that kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin have multitarget potential against AD.

The ethanol and ethyl acetate GB extracts showed an important inhibition percentage, higher than 80%, at a dose of 0.01 mg/mL. The effect of GB extracts on AD resulted in multitarget action through two pathways: firstly, inhibiting enzymes responsible for degrading neurotransmitters and forming amyloid plaques; secondly, decreasing ROS in the central nervous system (CNS), reducing its deterioration, and promoting the formation of amyloid plaques. The results of this work demonstrate the great potential of GB as a medicinal plant.",

Carriers of one copy of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) \u03b54 allele have a 4-fold increased AD risk, while APOE \u03b54/\u03b54-carriers have a 12-fold increased risk of developing AD in comparison with the APOE \u03b53-carriers. The main longevity factor is the homozygous APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype.

It is not fully understood how APOE variants may increase or decrease AD risk, but this gene may affect tau- and amyloid-mediated neurodegeneration directly or indirectly, also by affecting lipid metabolism and inflammation. For sporadic AD, epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may control and influence APOE expression in response to external insults.

Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF\u03b21 in the brain (TGF mice) recapitulate VCID-associated cerebrovascular pathology and develop cognitive deficits in old age or when submitted to comorbid cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. We characterized the cerebrovascular proteome of TGF mice using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. Cerebral arteries were surgically removed from 6-month-old-TGF and wild-type mice, and proteins were extracted and analyzed by gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS. We identified 3602 proteins in brain vessels, with 20 demonstrating significantly altered levels in TGF mice.

We have previously shown that, in brain endothelial cells (ECs), vasculotropic A\u03b2 species induce apoptosis through death receptors (DRs) DR4 and DR5 and mitochondria-mediated mechanisms, while FDA-approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) prevent mitochondria-mediated EC apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we analyzed A\u03b2-induced extrinsic and intrinsic (DR- and mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic pathways in BVSMC, aiming to unveil new therapeutic targets to prevent BVSMC stress and death. We show that both apoptotic pathways are activated in BVSMCs by oligomeric A\u03b242 and A\u03b240-Q22 (A\u03b2Q22) and mitochondrial respiration is severely impaired. Importantly, the CAIs methazolamide (MTZ) and acetazolamide (ATZ) prevent the pro-apoptotic effects in BVSMCs, while reducing caspase 3 activation and A\u03b2 deposition in the arterial walls of TgSwDI animals, a murine model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

We aim to emphasize microglial signatures in physiologic brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic literature search of all published articles about microglial senescence in human healthy aging and AD was performed, searching for PubMed and Scopus online databases. Among 1947 articles screened, a total of 289 articles were assessed for full-text eligibility. Microglial transcriptomic, phenotypic, and neuropathological profiles were analyzed comprising healthy aging and AD. Our review highlights that studies on animal models only partially clarify what happens in humans. Human and mice microglia are hugely heterogeneous. Like a two-sided coin, microglia can be protective or harmful, depending on the context. Brain health depends upon a balance between the actions and reactions of microglia maintaining brain homeostasis in cooperation with other cell types (especially astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). During aging, accumulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction weaken microglia leading to dystrophic/senescent, otherwise over-reactive, phenotype-enhancing neurodegenerative phenomena.

SORL1 mutations, occurring frequently in a subset of familial cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been documented, but their pathogenic potential is not yet clear and questions remain concerning their putative influence on the physiopathological processing of APP. We have assessed the influence of two SORL1 mutations that were described as likely disease-causing and that were associated with either benign (SorLA924) or severe (SorLA511) AD phenotypes. We examined the influence of wild-type and mutants SorLA in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing either wild-type or Swedish mutated APP on APP expression, secreted A\u03b2 and sAPP\u03b1 levels, intracellular A\u03b2 40 and A\u03b242 peptides, APP-CTFs (C99 and C83) expressions, \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases expressions and activities as well as A\u03b2 and CTFs-degrading enzymes. These paradigms were studied in control conditions or after pharmacological proteasomal modulation. We also established stably transfected CHO cells expressing wild-type SorLA and established the colocalization of APP and either wild-type or mutant SorLA. SorLA mutations partially disrupt co-localization of wild-type sorLA with APP. Overall, although we mostly confirmed previous data concerning the influence of wild-type SorLA on APP processing, we were unable to evidence significant alterations triggered by our set of SorLA mutants, whatever the cells or pharmacological conditions examined.

Endogenous CHCHD10 levels decline in the brains of ALS-FTD patients, and the CHCHD10S59L mutation in Drosophila induces dominant toxicity together with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a protein critical for the induction of mitophagy. However, whether and how CHCHD10 variants regulate mitophagy flux in the mammalian brain is unknown. Here, we demonstrate through in vivo and in vitro models, as well as human FTD brain tissue, that ALS/FTD-linked CHCHD10 mutations (R15L and S59L) impair mitophagy flux and mitochondrial Parkin recruitment, whereas wild-type CHCHD10 (CHCHD10WT) normally enhances these measures. Specifically, we show that CHCHD10R15L and CHCHD10S59L mutations reduce PINK1 levels by increasing PARL activity, whereas CHCHD10WT produces the opposite results through its stronger interaction with PARL, suppressing its activity. Importantly, we also demonstrate that FTD brains with TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) pathology demonstrate disruption of the PARL-PINK1 pathway and that experimentally impairing mitophagy promotes TDP-43 aggregation. Thus, we provide herein new insights into the regulation of mitophagy and TDP-43 aggregation in the mammalian brain through the CHCHD10-PARL-PINK1 pathway.",

They develop due to the pathological accumulation and aggregation of various misfolded proteins, axonal and synaptic loss and dysfunction, inflammation, cytoskeletal abnormalities, defects in DNA and RNA, and neuronal death. This leads to the activation of immune responses and the release of the antibodies against them. Recently, it has become clear that autoantibodies (Aabs) can contribute to demyelination, axonal loss, and brain and cognitive dysfunction. This has significantly changed the understanding of the participation of humoral autoimmunity in neurodegenerative disorders. It is crucial to understand how neuroinflammation is involved in neurodegeneration, to aid in improving the diagnostic and therapeutic value of Aabs in the future.

Our findings showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation measures, particularly rMTs and LTP-like plasticity, may be potential biomarkers to distinguish between different dementia subtypes. Impaired motor cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity were more prominent in AD and DLB than in FTD. This aligns with the evidence that cortical motor networks are usually spared in FTDs in early-to-middle stages.",

We investigated sex differences in brain atrophy in DLB using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We included 436 patients from the European-DLB consortium and the Mayo Clinic. Sex differences and sex-by-age interactions were assessed through visual atrophy rating scales (n\u00a0=\u00a0327; 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years, 62% males) and automated estimations of regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness (n\u00a0=\u00a0165; 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years, 72% males). We found a higher likelihood of frontal atrophy and smaller volumes in six cortical regions in males and thinner olfactory cortices in females. There were significant sex-by-age interactions in volume (six regions) and cortical thickness (seven regions) across the entire cortex. We demonstrate that males have more widespread cortical atrophy at younger ages, but differences tend to disappear with increasing age, with males and females converging around the age of 75. Male DLB patients had higher odds for frontal atrophy on radiological visual rating scales. Male DLB patients displayed a widespread pattern of cortical gray matter alterations on automated methods. Sex differences in gray matter measures in DLB tended to disappear with increasing age.",

We discuss the important distinction between in vitro and in vivo patterns of A\u03b2 aggregation, the impact of different aggregation stages on therapeutic strategies, and how future investigations could integrate this concept in order to produce a more thorough understanding and better treatment for Alzheimer's and other amyloid-related disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular senile plaques including amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles consisting of abnormal Tau. Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, and clinical evidence demonstrates that depressive symptoms accelerate the cognitive deficit of AD patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of depressive symptoms present in the process of AD remain unclear. Depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline in hTau mice were induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). Computational prediction and molecular experiments supported that an asparagine endopeptidase (AEP)-derived Tau fragment, Tau N368 interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-\u03b4). Further behavioral studies investigated the role of Tau N368-PPAR-\u03b4 interaction in depressive-like behaviors and cognitive declines of AD models exposed to CRS. We found that mitochondrial dysfunction was positively associated with depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits in hTau mice. Chronic stress increased Tau N368 and promoted the interaction of Tau N368 with PPAR-\u03b4, repressing PPAR-\u03b4-mediated transactivation in the hippocampus of mice. Then we predicted and identified the binding sites of PPAR-\u03b4. Finally, inhibition of AEP, clearance of Tau N368 and pharmacological activation of PPAR-\u03b4 effectively alleviated CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline in mice. These results demonstrate that Tau N368 in the hippocampus impairs mitochondrial function by suppressing PPAR-\u03b4, facilitating the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline. Therefore, our findings may provide new mechanistic insight in the pathophysiology of depression-like phenotype in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Normative modelling is a method for understanding the underlying heterogeneity within brain disorders like Alzheimer Disease (AD), by quantifying how each patient deviates from the expected normative pattern that has been learned from a healthy control distribution. Existing deep learning based normative models have been applied on only single modality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) neuroimaging data. However, these do not take into account the complementary information offered by multimodal M RI, which is essential for understanding a multifactorial disease like AD. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal variational autoencoder (mmVAE) based normative modelling framework that can capture the joint distribution between different modalities to identify abnormal brain volume deviations due to AD. Our multi-modal framework takes as input Freesurfer processed brain region volumes from T1-weighted (cortical and subcortical) and T2-weighed (hippocampal) scans of cognitively normal participants to learn the morphological characteristics of the healthy brain. The estimated normative model is then applied on AD patients to quantify the deviation in brain volumes and identify abnormal brain pattern deviations due to the progressive stages of AD. We compared our proposed mmVAE with a baseline unimodal VAE having a single encoder and decoder and the two modalities concatenated as unimodal input. Our experimental results show that deviation maps generated by mmVAE are more sensitive to disease staging within AD, have a better correlation with patient cognition and result in higher number of brain regions with statistically significant deviations compared to the unimodal baseline model.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological illness with insidious onset. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD and different pathological changes, the clinical phenotypes of dementia are diverse, and these pathological changes also interact with each other. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for biomarkers that can diagnose these pathological changes to improve the ability to monitor the course of disease and treat the disease. The pathological mechanism hypothesis with high recognition of AD mainly includes the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) around neurons and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which results in the development of neuronal fiber tangles (NFTs) and mitochondrial dysfunction. AD is an irreversible disease; currently, there is no clinical cure or delay in the disease process of drugs, and there is a lack of effective early clinical diagnosis methods. AD patients, often in the dementia stages and moderate cognitive impairment, will seek medical treatment. Biomarkers can help diagnose the presence or absence of specific diseases and their pathological processes, so early screening and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention and therapy of AD in clinical practice. \u03b2-amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration/neuronal damage (N), also known as the AT (N) biomarkers system, are widely validated core humoral markers for the diagnosis of AD. In this paper, the pathogenesis of AD related to AT (N) and the current research status of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood related biomarkers were reviewed. At the same time, the limitations of humoral markers in the diagnosis of AD were also discussed, and the future development of humoral markers for AD was prospected. In addition, the contents related to mitochondrial dysfunction, prion virology and intestinal microbiome related to AD are also described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of AD in many aspects and dimensions, so as to evaluate the pathological changes related to AD more comprehensively and accurately.",

The patient underwent routine laboratory tests, neuropsychological assessments, and neuroimaging examinations. Additionally, the cerebrospinal fluid sample was analyzed for AD biomarkers using the Single Molecular Array (Simoa) technique. A targeted Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) panel screening was also conducted. Routine blood and CSF laboratory tests, as well as CSF tap test, yielded negative results. Cranial MRI showed atrophy of the whole brain. PiB-PET scanning indicated that PiB was merely retained in her brain with an overall standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) <1.0.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction brain disorder brought on by the dysfunctional amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and clearance of APP peptides. Increased APP levels lead to the production of AD-related peptides including the amyloid APP intracellular domain (AICD) and amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and consequently modify the intrinsic excitability of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, synaptic protein activity, and impair synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses. The goal of the present study is to build computational models that incorporate the effect of AD-related peptides on CA1 pyramidal neuron and hippocampal synaptic plasticity under the AD conditions and investigate the potential pharmacological treatments that could normalize hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning in AD. We employ a phenomenological N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-based voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity model that includes the separate receptor contributions on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and embed it into the a detailed compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal neuron. Modeling results show that partial blockade of Glu2NB-NMDAR-gated channel restores intrinsic excitability of a CA1 pyramidal neuron and rescues LTP in AICD and A\u03b2 conditions. The model provides insight into the complex interactions in AD pathophysiology and suggests the conditions under which the synchronous activation of a cluster of synaptic inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA1 pyramidal neuron leads to restored synaptic plasticity.",

        "AbstractText": "Evidence-based interventions to protect against cognitive decline among older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are urgently needed. Rehabilitation approaches to support memory and behavioral/lifestyle interventions are recognized as promising strategies for preserving or improving cognitive health, although few previous interventions have combined both approaches. This paper describes the protocol of the Brain Boosters intervention, which synergistically combines training in compensatory and healthy lifestyle behaviors and supports implementation and tracking of new behaviors with a digital application. The study utilizes a single-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled design to compare a structured lifestyle and compensatory aid intervention to an education-only self-guided intervention. We plan to enroll 225 community-dwelling adults (25% from underrepresented groups) aged 65\u2009+\u2009who endorse subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and low baseline levels of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Both interventions will be administered in group format, consisting of 15 two-hour classes that occur weekly for ten weeks and taper to bi-monthly and monthly, for an intervention duration of 6\u00a0months. Participants in both interventions will receive education about a variety of memory support strategies and healthy lifestyle behaviors, focusing on physical and cognitive activity and stress management. The structured intervention will also receive support in adopting new behaviors and tracking set goals aided by the Electronic Memory and Management Aid (EMMA) digital application. Primary outcomes include global cognition (composite of memory, attention, and executive function tests) and everyday function (Everyday Cognition Questionnaire). Data will be collected at baseline and outcome visits, at approximately 6, 12, and 18\u00a0months. Qualitative interviews, self-report surveys (e.g., indicators of self-determination, health literacy) and EMMA data metrics will also be used to identify what components of the intervention are most effective and for whom they work. Successful project completion will provide valuable information about how individuals with SCD respond to a compensation and preventative lifestyle intervention assisted by a digital application, including an understanding of factors that may impact outcomes, treatment uptake, and adherence. The work will also inform development, scaling, and personalization of future interventions that can delay disability in individuals at risk for ADRD. ClinicalTrials.gov.

        "AbstractText": "Neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative disorders, represented paradigmatically by glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease, respectively, persist as formidable challenges in the biomedical realm. The interconnected molecular underpinnings of these conditions necessitate rigorous and novel therapeutic examinations. This comprehensive research was anchored on the premise of unveiling the therapeutic potential and specificity of Lupenone, a potent phytoconstituent, in targeting the molecular pathways underpinning both glioblastoma and Alzheimer's amyloid beta pathology. This was gauged through its interactions with key protein structures, 5H08 and 2ZHV. An integrative approach was adopted, marrying advanced proteomics and modern computer-aided drug design techniques. Molecular docking of Lupenone with 5H08 and 2ZHV was meticulously executed, with subsequent molecular dynamics simulations providing insights into the stability, viability, and intricacies of these interactions. Lupenone demonstrated profound binding affinities, evidenced by robust docking scores of -9.54\u00a0kcal/mol for 5H08 and -10.59\u00a0kcal/mol for 2ZHV. These interactions underscored Lupenone's eminent therapeutic potential in mitigating glioblastoma and modulating the amyloid beta pathology inherent to Alzheimer's. The introduction of Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) further magnified the therapeutic prospects, accentuating Lupenone's efficacy. The findings of this study not only underscore the therapeutic acumen of Lupenone in addressing the challenges posed by glioblastoma and Alzheimer's but also lay a strong foundation for its consideration as a leading candidate in future neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative research endeavors. Given the compelling in-silico data, a clarion call is made for its empirical validation in holistic in-vivo settings, potentially pioneering a new therapeutic epoch in both glioblastoma and Alzheimer's interventions.",

Blood biomarkers are less invasive, easier to obtain and achievable by a cheaper means than those on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly more economic than functional neuroimaging investigations; thus, a great interest is focused on blood isoforms of the phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), indicators of ongoing tau pathology (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs, an AD neuropathological hallmark) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, current data often highlight discordant results about the ability of blood pTau to predict CSF status. We aim to synthesise the studies that compared pTau levels on CSF and blood to assess their correlation in AD continuum. We performed a narrative literature review using, first, MEDLINE (via PubMed) by means of MeSH terms, and then, we expanded the reults by means of Scopus and Web of Sciences to be as inclusive as possible. Finally, we added work following an expert opinion. Only papers presenting original data on pTau values on both blood and CSF were included.

Most studies evaluated plasma pTau181, while data on other isoforms and serum are scarcer. Most papers identify a correlation between CSF and blood measurements. Furthermore, even when not specified, it is often possible to show an increase in blood pTau values as AD-related damage progresses in the AD continuum and higher values in AD than in other neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, plasma pTau231 seems the first biomarker to look for in the earliest and pre-clinical stages, quickly followed by pTau217 and, finally, by pTau181.

These processes have been linked to disease progression and a decline in cognitive function. Various therapeutic approaches aim at the prevention or reduction of tau aggregates in neurons. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a very valuable tool in neuroscience discovery, as they offer access to potentially unlimited amounts of cell types that are affected in disease, including cortical neurons, for in vitro studies. We have generated an in vitro model for tau aggregation that uses hiPSC - derived neurons expressing an aggregation prone, fluorescently tagged version of the human tau protein after lentiviral transduction. Upon addition of tau seeds in the form of recombinant sonicated paired helical filaments (sPHFs), the neurons show robust, disease-like aggregation of the tau protein. The model was developed as a plate-based high content screening assay coupled with an image analysis algorithm to evaluate the impact of small molecules or genetic perturbations on tau. We show that the assay can be used to evaluate small molecules or screen targeted compound libraries. Using siRNA-based gene knockdown, genes of interest can be evaluated, and we could show that a targeted gene library can be screened, by screening nearly 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in that assay. The assay uses an imaging-based readout, a relatively short timeline, quantifies the extent of tau aggregation, and also allows the assessment of cell viability. Furthermore, it can be easily adapted to different hiPSC lines or neuronal subtypes. Taken together, this complex and highly relevant approach can be routinely applied on a weekly basis in the screening funnels of several projects and generates data with a turnaround time of approximately five weeks.",

We carried out a series of mouse studies designed to: i) compare brain and metabolic responses while on oral N-PPG treatment (50\u00a0mg/kg, 9-14\u00a0days) of B6CBA wildtype (WT) and short-lived transgenic R6/2 (HD) mice; and ii) evaluate potential brain and systemwide stress rebound responses in WT mice 2\u00a0months after cessation of extended mitohormesis induction by well-tolerated higher doses of N-PPG (100-200\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0x\u00a060\u00a0days). WT and HD mice showed comparable global evidence of N-PPG induced brain mitohormesis characterized by Prodh protein decay and increased mitochondrial expression of chaperone and Yme1l1 protease proteins. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis (RNAseq) showed partial normalization of HD whole brain transcriptomes toward those of WT mice. Comprehensive metabolomic profiles performed on control and N-PPG treated blood, brain, and kidney samples revealed expected N-PPG-induced tissue increases in proline levels in both WT and HD mice, accompanied by surprising parallel increases in hydroxyproline and sarcosine. Two months after cessation of the higher dose N-PPG stress treatments, WT mouse brains showed robust rebound increases in Prodh protein levels and mitochondrial transcriptome responses, as well as altered profiles of blood amino acid-related metabolites. Our HD and WT mouse preclinical findings point to the brain penetrating and mitohormesis-inducing potential of the drug candidate, N-PPG, and provide new rationale and application insights supporting its further preclinical testing in various models of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of mitochondrial proteostasis.",

        "AbstractText": "A biomembrane-related fibrillogenesis of Amyloid \u03b2 from Alzheimer' disease (A\u03b2) is closely related to its accumulation behavior. A binding property of A\u03b2 peptides from Alzheimer' disease to lipid membranes was then classified by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method combined with an immobilization technique using thiol self-assembled membrane. The accumulated amounts of A\u03b2, \u0394fmax, was determined from the measurement of the maximal frequency reduction using QCM. The plots of \u0394fmax to A\u03b2 concentration gave the slope and saturated value of \u0394fmax, (\u0394fmax)sat that are the parameters for binding property of A\u03b2 to lipid membranes. Therefore, the A\u03b2-binding property on lipid membranes was classified by the slope and (\u0394fmax)sat. The plural lipid system was described as X\u00a0+\u00a0Y where X\u00a0=\u00a0L1, L1/L2, and L1/L2/L3. The slope and (\u0394fmax)sat values plotted as a function of mixing ratio of Y to X was classified on a basis of the lever principle (LP). The LP violation observed in both parameters resulted from the formation of the crevice or pothole, as A\u03b2-specific binding site, generated at the boundary between ld and lo phases. The LP violation observed only in the slope resulted from glycolipid-rich domain acting as A\u03b2-specific binding site. Furthermore, lipid planar membranes indicating strong LP violation favored strong fibrillogenesis. Especially, lipid planar membranes indicating the LP violation only in the slope induced lateral aggregated and spherulitic fibrillar aggregates. Thus, the classification of A\u03b2 binding property on lipid membranes appeared to be related to the fibrillogenesis with a certain morphology.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders (NDs) have become a major cause of both cognitive and physical disabilities worldwide. In NDs, misfolded proteins tend to adopt a \u03b2-sheet-rich fibrillar structure called amyloid. Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plays a crucial role in the nervous system. The misfolding and aggregation of A\u03b2 are primary factors in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the oligomerization and aggregation of A\u03b2 is considered as an effective strategy against NDs. While it is known that berberine analogs exhibit anti-A\u03b2 aggregation properties, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we have employed computational approaches to unravel the possible mechanism by which berberine combats A\u03b2 aggregation. The introduction of berberine was observed to delay the equilibrium of A\u03b216-21 oligomerization. Initially, within the first 10\u00a0ns of simulation, \u03b2-sheets content was 12.89\u00a0% and gradually increased to 22.19\u00a0% within the first 20\u00a0ns. This upward trend continued, reaching 32.80\u00a0%. However, berberine substantially reduced the formation of \u03b2-sheets to 1.36\u00a0%. These findings decipher the potency of berberine against A\u03b216-21 oligomerization, a crucial step for \u03b2-sheet formation. Additionally, a remarkable decrease in total number of hydrogen bonds was found in the presence of berberine. Berberine also led to a slight reduction in the flexibility of A\u03b216-21, which may be due to the formation of a more stable structures. This study offers valuable insights at the mechanistic level, which could prove beneficial in the development of new drugs to combat NDs.",

        "AbstractText": "In humans, the cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein (CYFIP) family consists of two members, namely CYFIP1 and CYFIP2. Both CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 function in the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which regulates actin polymerization. Additionally, these two proteins form a posttranscriptional regulatory complex with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which suppresses mRNA translation. Thus, CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 are important signalling regulators at synapses, and mutations in their genes are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including intellectual disabilities. Moreover, dysregulation of the CYFIP protein family is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relevance of the CYFIP family in other dementias is largely unknown. Here, we compared CYFIP1/2 protein levels in the post-mortem hippocampus from patients with AD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Consistent with previous findings, CYFIP2 was reduced in AD hippocampus. In DLB and VaD hippocampus, the protein level of CYFIP2 and CYFIP1 was unaltered. Finally, an increase in the protein level of both CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 was noted in FTLD-TDP hippocampus. These findings reveal that the protein levels of the CYFIP family is distinct in different types of dementia, suggesting that the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders has divergent impacts on hippocampal synaptic function.",

The objective of this study was to assess the quantitative impact of neurodegenerative diseases in rural areas of the Spanish-Portuguese border region and to describe the epidemiological profile of the most prevalent disorders in one of the most depopulated and aged regions of Europe. A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed to estimate the prevalence of subjects diagnosed with the most common neurodegenerative disorders: dementia (Alzheimer's disease and other dementias), Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism, and multiple sclerosis in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border border region in 2020. It includes Bragan\u00e7a and Guarda Districts (Portugal) and Salamanca (Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain). Neurodegenerative diseases accounted for 1.85% in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region in 2020; a total of 5,819 records were reported: 987 (prevalence, 2.51%) in Salamanca (Spain); 2,332 (prevalence, 1.87%) in Bragan\u00e7a; and 2,500 (prevalence, 1.66%) in Guarda.

These disorders impacted older age groups. In the rural border region of Spain, 1 out of 4 cases were institutionalized. The findings reveal the health impact of neurodegenerative diseases in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region.

Consequently, the disproportionately high risk and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) among rural and minoritized older residents will likely increase. To address this threat, we tested the hypotheses that (1) a faith-based, resident-led approach would increase basic ADRD knowledge and diagnosis, and (2) older age, female gender, lower educational levels, and more years lived rural would predict number of referrals, new dementia diagnoses, and treatment. An adaptation of Schoenberg's Faith Moves Mountains model, previously successful in detection and management of other chronic illnesses in rural settings, guided this community-based participatory research. Local faith community members were trained as research assistants to recruit, administer surveys, conduct brief memory assessments, teach brain health strategies, and follow-up with residents.

This rural sample was racially and ethnically diverse (74.5% non-White), with 28% reporting eight or less years of formal education.

In the last few years, there has been a significant upsurge in the level of interest towards the function of molecular chaperones in the control of misfolding and aggregation. The crucial molecular chaperones implicated in neurodegenerative illnesses are covered in this review article, along with a variety of their different methods of action. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones serve critical roles in preserving protein homeostasis. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones have integral roles in preserving regulation of protein balance. It has been demonstrated that aging, a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, affects how molecular chaperones function. The aggregation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration may be facilitated by the aging-related reduction in chaperone activity. Molecular chaperones have also been linked to the pathophysiology of several instances of neuron withering illnesses, enumerating as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones have become potential therapy targets concerning with the prevention and therapeutic approach for brain disorders due to their crucial function in protein homeostasis and their connection to neurodegenerative illnesses. Protein homeostasis can be restored, and illness progression can be slowed down by methods that increase chaperone function or modify their expression. This review emphasizes the importance of molecular chaperones in the context of neuron withering disorders and their potential as therapeutic targets for brain disorders.",

Using the gold-modified nanopipette sensor with a copper chelating ligand, we evaluated the accumulation ability of the liposomal form of an anticancer Cu-containing complex at three levels of biological organization. First, we detected Cu2+ ions in a single cell model of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and in murine melanoma B16 cells. The insertion of the nanoelectrode did not result in leakage of the cell membrane. We then evaluated the distribution of the Cu-complex in MCF-7 tumor spheroids and found that the diffusion-limited accumulation was a function of the depth, typical for 3D culture. Finally, we demonstrated the use of the sensor for Cu2+ ion detection in the brain of an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and tumor-bearing mice in response to injection (2 mg kg-1) of the liposomal form of the anticancer Cu-containing complex. Enhanced stability and selectivity, as well as distinct copper oxidation peaks, confirmed that the developed sensor is a promising tool for testing various types of biological systems. In summary, this research has demonstrated a minimally invasive electrochemical technique with high temporal resolution that can be used for the study of metabolism of copper or copper-based drugs in vitro and in vivo.",

Here we investigate how the water modality affects conformational changes, solubility, and motion of fibrillar proteins. The hypothesis is that the introduction of a poly hydroxyl amino acid would increase solvation of the fibril forming peptides, preventing their misfolding and aggregation. For the amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, which is considered to be connected with nervous system diseases, including dementia and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of \u03b2-sheet fibrils always occurs with a conformational change and a decrease in the dynamic hydration shell around A\u03b2(1-42). We present novel cyclic d-amino acid peptides that effectively inhibit fibrillation through affecting the dynamic hydration shell of A\u03b2(1-42) in vitro. Using de novo design within the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), five different peptides that recognize Alzheimer's fibrils were designed and synthesized. Three of them were cyclic all-d-amino acid peptides incorporating the same polyhydroxy building block derived from d-glucosaminic acid (GA). One peptide was the parent cyclic all d-amino acid inhibitor with no GA incorporated, and another was an all l-amino acid linear fibrillation inhibitor. The GA-containing peptides were found to show significantly improved inhibition of A\u03b2(1-42) aggregation. The inhibition was dramatically improved by the synergistic application of two GA peptides targeting each end of the growing fibril.

Subsequently my team discovered that this PHF protein and the microtubule-associated factor called tau were one and the same protein. However, we found that tau in neurofibrillary tangles/PHFs in AD brain was abnormally hyperphosphorylated, and unlike normal tau, which promoted the assembly of tubulin into microtubules, the AD-hyperphosphorylated tau inhibited microtubule assembly. These discoveries of tau pathology in AD opened a new and a major area of research on tau and on the molecular pathology of this major cause of dementia in middle- and old-age individuals. Tau pathology, which without fail is made up of the aggregated hyperphosphorylated state of the protein, is also the hallmark lesion of a family of around 20 related neurodegenerative diseases, called tauopathies. Currently, tau pathology is a major drug target for the treatment of AD and related tauopathies. Both active and passive tau immunization human clinical trials at various stages are underway.

Early and accurate detection of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) (1-42) monomers, a key biomarker of AD pathology, is crucial for effective diagnosis and intervention of the disease. Current gold standard detection techniques for A\u03b2 include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. Although reliable, they are limited by their cost and time-consuming nature, thus restricting their point-of-care applicability. Here we present a sensitive and rapid colorimetric sensor for the detection of A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers within 5 min. This was achieved by harnessing the peroxidase-like activity of metal-loaded metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically UiO-66-NH2, coupled with the strong affinity of A\u03b2 (1-42) to the MOFs. Various metal-loaded MOFs were synthesized and investigated, and platinum-loaded UiO-66-NH2 was identified as the optimal candidate for our purpose. The Pt-loaded UiO-66-NH2 sensor demonstrated detection limits of 2.76 and 4.65 nM A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers in water and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, with a linear range from 0.75 to 25 nM (R2 = 0.9712), outperforming traditional detection techniques in terms of both detection time and complexity. Moreover, the assay was specific toward A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers when evaluated against interfering compounds.

This intriguing finding raises the possibility that circRNAs may have a central role in the initiation and progression of AD. Notably, different categories of circRNAs, including HDAC9, HOMER1, Cwc27, Tulp4, and PTK2, have been implicated in driving the pathological changes associated with AD through diverse mechanisms. For instance, these circRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to the accumulation of beta-amyloid, which is a hallmark characteristic of AD. Additionally, these circRNAs contribute to the excessive phosphorylation of tau protein, a phenomenon associated with neurofibrillary tangles, further exacerbating the disease. Moreover, they are involved in aggravating neuroinflammation, which is known to play a critical role in AD's pathogenesis. Lastly, these circRNAs can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupting cellular energy production and leading to cognitive impairment. As researchers delve deeper into the intricate workings of circRNAs, they hope to unlock its full potential as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for innovative treatments and better management of such devastating conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are aging related diseases with high incidence. Because of the correlation of incidence rate and some possible mechanisms of comorbidity, the two diseases have been studied in combination by many researchers, and even some scholars call AD type 3 diabetes. But the relationship between the two is still controversial. This study used seed-based d mapping software to conduct a meta-analysis of the whole brain resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study, exploring the differences in amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) between patients (AD or T2DM) and healthy controls (HCs), and searching for neuroimaging evidence that can explain the relationship between the two diseases. The final study included 22 datasets of ALFF and 22 datasets of CBF. The results of T2DM group showed that ALFF increased in both cerebellum and left inferior temporal gyrus regions, but decreased in left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus, and left anterior central gyrus regions. In the T2DM group, CBF increased in the right supplementary motor area, while decreased in the middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus. The results of the AD group showed that the ALFF increased in the right cerebellum, right hippocampus, and right striatum, while decreased in the precuneus gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus. In the AD group, CBF in the anterior precuneus gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus decreased. Multimodal analysis within a disease showed that ALFF and CBF both decreased in the occipital lobe of the T2DM group and in the precuneus and parietal lobe of the AD group. In addition, there was a common decrease of CBF in the right middle occipital gyrus in both groups. Based on neuroimaging evidence, we believe that T2DM and AD are two diseases with their respective characteristics of central nervous activity and cerebral perfusion. The changes in CBF between the two diseases partially overlap, which is consistent with their respective clinical characteristics and also indicates a close relationship between them.

        "AbstractText": "Tau propagation, pathogenesis, and neurotoxicity are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases that result in cognitive impairment. Tau accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), progressive supranuclear palsy, and related tauopathies. Knowledge of the mechanisms for tau propagation in neurodegeneration is necessary for understanding the development of dementia. Exosomes, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), have emerged as participants in promoting tau propagation. Recent findings show that EVs generated by neurons expressing familial mutations of tauopathies of FTDP-17 (P301L and V337M) (mTau) and presenilin (A246E) (mPS1) in AD induce tau propagation and accumulation after injection into rodent brain. To gain knowledge of the proteome cargoes of the mTau and mPS1 EVs that promote tau pathogenesis, this review compares the proteomes of these EVs, which results in important new questions concerning EV mechanisms of tau pathogenesis. Proteomics data show that EVs produced by mTau- and mPS1-expressing iPSC neurons share proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicle secretion and, notably, these EVs also possess differences in protein components of vesicle-mediated transport, extracellular functions, and cell adhesion. It will be important for future studies to gain an understanding of the breadth of familial genetic mutations of tau, presenilin, and other genes in promoting EV initiation of tau propagation and pathogenesis. Furthermore, elucidation of EV cargo components that mediate tau propagation will have potential as biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to ameliorate dementia of tauopathies.",

        "AbstractText": "\u03b2-Amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) deposition in the brain is an important pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which is regulated transcriptionally by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), is able to proteolyze A\u03b2. One of the members of the MAPK family, ERK, is able to mediate the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Ginsenoside Rg1 is one of the active ingredients in the natural medicine ginseng and has inhibitory effects on A\u03b2 production. The present study was designed to investigate whether ginsenoside Rg1 is able to affect the regulation of PPAR\u03b3 based on the expression of its target gene, IDE, and whether it is able to promote A\u03b2 degradation via inhibition of the ERK/PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation pathway. In the present study, primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with A\u03b21-42, ginsenoside Rg1 and the ERK inhibitor PD98059, and subsequently TUNEL staining was used to detect the level of neuronal apoptosis. ELISA was subsequently employed to detect the intra- and extracellular A\u03b21-42 levels, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to detect the translocation of ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, immunofluorescence double staining was used to detect the co-expression of ERK and PPAR\u03b3, and finally, western blotting was used to detect the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112 and IDE expression. The results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 or PD98059 were able to inhibit primary cultured hippocampal neuron apoptosis induced by A\u03b21-42 treatment, reduce the levels of intra- and extraneuronal A\u03b21-42 and inhibit the translocation of ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, administration of ginsenoside Rg1 or PD98059 resulted in attenuated co-expression of ERK and PPAR\u03b3, inhibition of phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112 mediated by ERK and an increase in IDE expression. In addition, the effects when PD98059 to inhibit ERK followed by treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 were found to be more pronounced than those when using PD98059 alone. In conclusion, ginsenoside Rg1 was demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects on AD via inhibition of the ERK/PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation pathway, which led to an increase in IDE expression, the promotion of A\u03b2 degradation and the decrease of neuronal apoptosis. These results could provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ginsenoside Rg1 in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Icariside II (ICS II) is known to confer notable therapeutic effects against a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of ICS II on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced SK-N-SH cell injury, in addition to understanding the underlying mechanism of action. The MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cell model was used to simulate PD in vitro. The viability and mitochondrial membrane potential of SK-N-SH cells were detected by MTT assay and JC-1 staining, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, ATP levels and complex I activity in treated SK-N-SH cells were measured using LDH activity, ATP and Complex I assay kits, respectively. The protein expression levels of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and \u03b3-H2A histone family member X and the copy number of mitochondrial DNA were measured by western blotting or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, respectively. Autodock 4.2 was used to predict the molecular docking site of ICS II on HDAC2. The results of the present study demonstrated that ICS II mitigated SK-N-SH cytotoxicity induced by MPP+. Specifically, ICS II alleviated DNA damage and restored mitochondrial function in SK-N-SH cells treated with MPP+. In addition, ICS II reduced the HDAC2 protein expression levels in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells. However, overexpression of HDAC2 reversed the protective effects of ICS II on DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that ICS II can protect dopaminergic neurons from MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by downregulating HDAC2 expression to restore mitochondrial function.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Mobile circular DNAs regulating memory and communication in CNS neurons.",
        "AbstractText": "Stimuli that stimulate neurons elicit transcription of immediate-early genes, a process which requires local sites of chromosomal DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by topoisomerase IIb within a few minutes, followed by repair within a few hours. Wakefulness, exploring a novel environment, and contextual fear conditioning also elicit turn-on of synaptic genes requiring DSBs and repair. It has been reported (in non-neuronal cells) that extrachromosomal circular DNA can form at DSBs as the sites are repaired. I propose that activated neurons may generate extrachromosomal circular DNAs during repair at DSB sites, thus creating long-lasting \"markers\" of that activity pattern which contain sequences from their sites of origin and which regulate long-term gene expression. Although the population of extrachromosomal DNAs is diverse and overall associated with pathology, a subclass of small circular DNAs (\"microDNAs,\" \u223c100-400 bases long), largely derives from unique genomic sequences and has attractive features to act as stable, mobile circular DNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Circular DNAs can be templates for the transcription of RNAs, particularly small inhibitory siRNAs, circular RNAs and other non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNAs. These may regulate translation and transcription of other genes involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Another possible fate for mobile DNAs is to be inserted stably into chromosomes after new DSB sites are generated in response to subsequent activation events. Thus, the insertions of mobile DNAs into activity-induced genes may tend to inactivate them and aid in homeostatic regulation to avoid over-excitation, as well as providing a \"counter\" for a neuron's activation history. Moreover, activated neurons release secretory exosomes that can be transferred to recipient cells to regulate their gene expression. Mobile DNAs may be packaged into exosomes, released in an activity-dependent manner, and transferred to recipient cells, where they may be templates for regulatory RNAs and possibly incorporated into chromosomes. Finally, aging and neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) are also associated with an increase in DSBs in neurons. It will become important in the future to assess how pathology-associated DSBs may relate to activity-induced mobile DNAs, and whether the latter may potentially contribute to pathogenesis.",

A relevant part of the way of speaking is what is known as prosody, or the variations a speaker makes when talking. To our knowledge, no research has analyzed the relevance of communication for caregivers when speaking with AD patients or what they consider the most effective strategies to communicate with them. Therefore, this pilot study aims are twofold: to know the relevance caregivers (professionals and family) give to communication with AD patients; and to determine what prosody strategies they consider most effective. Two hundred fifty-two caregivers of AD patients (professional and family) participated in two online surveys, answering different questions about the relevance of communication and the best prosody strategies. They also performed an auditory perceptual assessment. The results showed that caregivers give communication a significant role in the patient's treatment behavior. They consider Alzheimer's (AD) patients should be spoken to with authority but with affection and positiveness. The most valued prosodic strategies were marked intonation, speaking affectionately, emphasizing essential words, a medium/low pitch, and a slow speed.

These include alterations in cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and tissue biomechanics. Noninvasive quantitative assessment of neurofluid flow and tissue motion is feasible with phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC MRI). While two-dimensional (2D) PC MRI is routinely utilized in research and clinical settings to assess flow dynamics through a single imaging slice, comprehensive neurofluid dynamic assessment can be limited or impractical. Recently, four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI (or time-resolved three-dimensional PC with three-directional velocity encoding) has emerged as a powerful extension of 2D PC, allowing for large volumetric coverage of fluid velocities at high spatiotemporal resolution within clinically reasonable scan times. Yet, most 4D flow studies have focused on blood flow imaging. Characterizing CSF flow dynamics with 4D flow (i.e., 4D CSF flow) is of high interest to understand normal brain and spine physiology, but also to study neurological disorders such as dysfunctional brain metabolite waste clearance, where CSF dynamics appear to play an important role. However, 4D CSF flow imaging is challenged by the long T1 time of CSF and slower velocities compared with blood flow, which can result in longer scan times from low flip angles and extended motion-sensitive gradients, hindering clinical adoption. In this work, we review the state of 4D CSF flow MRI including challenges, novel solutions from current research and ongoing needs, examples of clinical and research applications, and discuss an outlook on the future of 4D CSF flow.",

The effects of chronic glutamate hyperactivity on vesicular and protein transport within CNS neurons, that is, processes necessary for neurite growth, have not been examined previously. In this study, we measured the effects of lifelong hyperactivity of glutamate neurotransmission on axoplasmic transport in CNS neurons. We compared wild-type (wt) to transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing the glutamate dehydrogenase gene Glud1 in CNS neurons and exhibiting increases in glutamate transmitter formation, release, and synaptic activation in brain throughout the lifespan. We found that Glud1 Tg as compared with wt mice exhibited increases in the rate of anterograde axoplasmic transport in neurons of the hippocampus measured in brain slices ex\u00a0vivo, and in olfactory neurons measured in vivo. We also showed that the in vitro pharmacologic activation of glutamate synapses in wt mice led to moderate increases in axoplasmic transport, while exposure to selective inhibitors of ion channel forming glutamate receptors very significantly suppressed anterograde transport, suggesting a link between synaptic glutamate receptor activation and axoplasmic transport. Finally, axoplasmic transport in olfactory neurons of Tg mice in vivo was partially inhibited following 14-day intake of ethanol, a known suppressor of axoplasmic transport and of glutamate neurotransmission. The same was true for transport in hippocampal neurons in slices from Glud1 Tg mice exposed to ethanol for 2\u2009h ex\u00a0vivo.

        "AbstractText": "The aggregation of amyloid \u03b2(A\u03b2) peptides is at the heart of Alzheimer's disease development and progression. As a result, amyloid aggregates have been studied extensively in vitro, and detailed structural information on fibrillar amyloid aggregates is available. However, forwarding these structural models to amyloid plaques in the human brain is still a major challenge. The chemistry of amyloid plaques, particularly in terms of the protein secondary structure and associated chemical moieties, remains poorly understood. In this report, we use Raman microspectroscopy to identify the presence of carotenoids in amyloid plaques and demonstrate that the abundance of carotenoids is correlated with the overall protein secondary structure of plaques, specifically to the population of \u03b2-sheets. While the association of carotenoids with plaques has been previously identified, their correlation with the \u03b2 structure has never been identified. To further validate these findings, we have used optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy, which is a spatially resolved technique that yields complementary infrared contrast to Raman. O-PTIR unequivocally demonstrates the presence of elevated \u03b2-sheets in carotenoid-containing plaques and the lack of \u03b2 structure in noncarotenoid plaques. Our findings underscore the potential link between anti-inflammatory species as carotenoids to specific secondary structural motifs within A\u03b2 plaques and highlight the possible role of chemically distinct plaques in neuroinflammation, which can uncover new mechanistic insights and lead to new therapeutic strategies for AD.",

We then used data from waves 5 to 12 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to illustrate the steps. The 10 steps are as follows: (1) select every variable that measures a health problem; (2) exclude variables with more than 5% missing values; (3) recode the responses to 0 (no deficit) through 1 (deficit); (4) exclude variables when coded deficits are too rare (< 1%) or too common (> 80%); (5) screen the variables for association with age; (6) screen the variables for correlation with each other; (7) count the variables retained; (8) calculate the frailty index scores; (9) test the characteristics of the frailty index; (10) use the frailty index in analyses.

        "AbstractText": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, primarily in individuals under 65 years of age, and is the second most common form of dementia worldwide. There is no cure for FTD and current treatments offer limited symptomatic relief. Regular physical activity exhibits cognitive and neuroprotective benefits in healthy individuals and in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but few studies have examined its efficacy in FTD. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of voluntary exercise training (VET) on the metabolic and behavioral characteristics of the rTg4510 transgenic mouse model of familial FTD. We show that regardless of genotype, VET increased energy expenditure, decreased sleep duration, and improved long-term memory in rTg4510 mice and WT littermates. Moreover, VET appeared to improve hyperactivity, a common feature of FTD, in rTg4510 mice. Although further work is required, these findings provide important insights into the potential benefits of physical activity in FTD.",

        "AbstractText": "The temporal lobe of the human brain contains the entorhinal cortex (EC). This region of the brain is a highly interconnected integrative hub for sensory and spatial information; it also has a key role in episodic memory formation and is the main source of cortical hippocampal inputs1-4. The human EC continues to develop during childhood5, but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic\u00a0eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5+RELN+ inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5+RELN+ cells6,7. Our investigation reveals that many of these cells arrive in the EC through a major postnatal migratory stream in early childhood.",

A machine-learning algorithm was also used to assemble these plasma biomarkers and optimize their performance in discriminating individual stages of Alzheimer's dementia progression. The \"composite-info\" biomarker panel, which combines these biomarkers and clinical information, considerably improved the staging performance in AD progression.

Owing to the lack of effective brain delivery approaches and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), current AD therapeutic endeavors are severely limited. Herein, a multifunctional delivery system (RVG-DDQ/PDP@siBACE1) is elaborately combined with a protein kinase B\u00a0(AKT) agonist (SC79) for facilitating RVG-DDQ/PDP@siBACE1 to target and penetrate BBB, enter brain parenchyma, and further accumulate in AD brain lesion. Moreover, compared with the unitary dose of RVG-DDQ/PDP@siBACE1, this collaborative therapy strategy exhibits a distinctive synergistic function including scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreasing of A\u03b2 production, alleviating neuroinflammation by promoting the polarized microglia into the anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype and significantly enhancing the cognitive functions of AD mice. More strikingly, according to these results, an innovative signaling pathway \"lncRNA MALAT1/miR-181c/BCL2L11\" is found that can mediate the neuronal apoptosis of AD. Taken together, combining the brain targeted delivery system with noninvasive BBB opening can provide a promising strategy and platform for targeting treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurologic condition that results in the deterioration of several brain processes (e.g. memory loss). The most notable physical alteration in AD is the impairment of brain cells. An accurate examination of brain pictures may help to find the disease earlier because early diagnosis is crucial to enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes. Therefore, an easy and error-free system for AD diagnosis has recently received much research attention. Conventional image processing techniques sometimes cannot observe the significant features. As a result, the objective of this research is to develop an accurate and efficient method for identifying AD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To begin with, the brain regions in the MRI images are segmented using a powerful Deep ResUnet-based approach. Then, the global and local features from the segmented images are recovered using a Multi-Scale Attention Siamese Network (MASNet)-based network. After extracting the features, the Slime Mould Algorithm-based feature selection process is conducted. Finally, the stages of AD are categorized using the EfficientNetB7 model. The efficacy of the presented method has been tested using brain MRI scans from the Kaggle dataset and the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and it achieves 99.31% and 99.38% accuracy, respectively. Finally, the study results show that the suggested method is helpful for accurate AD categorization.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR), leucine-rich-repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is one of the key players in neuroinflammation, which is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Activated NLRP3 causes release of pro-inflammatory molecules that aggravate neurodegeneration. Thus, pharmacologically inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome has the potential to alleviate the inflammatory injury to the neurons. Coumarin is a multifunctional nucleus with potent anti-inflammatory properties and can be utilized to develop novel drugs for the treatment and management of AD. In the present study, we have explored the NLRP3-inhibitory activities of a library of coumarin derivatives through a computational drug discovery approach. Drug-like, PAINS free, and potentially BBB permeable compounds were screened out and subjected to molecular docking and in silico ADMET studies, resulting in three virtual hits, i.e. MolPort-050-872-358, MolPort-050-884-068, and MolPort-051-135-630. The hits exhibited better NLRP3-binding affinity than MCC950, a selective inhibitor of NLRP3. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-MD simulation analyses, and binding free energy calculations of the hits established their potential as promising virtual leads with a common coumarin scaffold for the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A set of enzyme-based and cell-based methods were used to evaluate the inhibitory potency of new compounds, their interaction with the enzyme, and their cytotoxicity. Most compounds exhibited significantly a higher inhibitory potential compared to published benzothiazolyl ureas and good target engagement in a cellular environment accompanied by low cytotoxicity. The best hits displayed mixed-type inhibition with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the nanomolar range for the purified enzyme (3-7, 15) and/or low micromolar IC50 values in the cell-based assay (6, 13-16).",

        "AbstractText": "With each passing year, the number of people suffering from mental disorders grows at a disturbing speed. Neuroactive steroids are a new promising group of drugs with the potential for use in many diseases like postpartum depression, postnatal psychosis, major depression, insomnia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's tremor, due to their ability to modulate the activity of GABAA receptor. Neurosteroids are progesterone metabolites that are synthesized from cholesterol or steroid hormones in various brain regions. They regulate neuronal development, regeneration, and neurotransmission. They are implicated in mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, PTSD, and impulsive aggression. Neurosteroids have been studied for their potential to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated dementia. They can promote neurogenesis, neuronal survival, myelination, and memory function. They can also affect the growth and sensitivity of hormone-dependent brain tumors such as gliomas. Zuranolone, a newly registered neurosteroid drug has shown huge flexibility in both clinical and ambulatory treatment thanks to its pharmacokinetic traits, especially the possibility for oral administration, unlike its predecessor Brexanolone. Zuranolone is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor that can be taken orally. The review aims to summarize the current knowledge on zuranolone as a novel neurosteroid drug for various mental disorders, especially for postpartum mental disorders for which this drug was meant originally. It covers studies indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases published since 2017. Keywords used in the search, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, are given in the aims and methodology section. The review explains the evidence for the role of neurosteroids, especially allopregnanolone, in the pathophysiology and treatment of postpartum depression. It discusses the mechanisms of neurosteroid action, the changes in neurosteroid levels during pregnancy and postpartum, and the clinical trials of brexanolone and zuranolone, two synthetic analogs of allopregnanolone, for postpartum depression. It provides an overview of the biosynthesis and metabolism of neurosteroids in the central and peripheral nervous system. Furthermore, it explains the different sources and pathways of neurosteroid production and the factors that influence their synthesis and regulation, such as stress, hormones, drugs, and genetic variations. The review also explores the potential relevance of neurosteroids for other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Finally, it highlights the associations between neurosteroid levels and symptom severity and the effects of neurosteroid modulation on mood, cognition, and neuroplasticity.",

        "AbstractText": "In disorders of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration is the final common pathway of disease progression. Modulating, reversing, or preventing disease progression is a clinical imperative most likely to succeed following accurate and explanatory understanding of neurodegeneration, requiring enhanced consistency with quantitative measurements and expanded interpretability of complex data. The on-going study of neurodegeneration has robustly demonstrated the advantages of accumulating large amounts of clinical data that include neuroimaging, motiving multi-center studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Demonstrative advantages also arise from highly multivariate analysis methods, and this work reports advances provided by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF revealed patterns of covariance for glucose metabolism, estimated by positron emission tomography of [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, in 243 healthy normal participants of ADNI. Patterns for glucose metabolism provided cross-sectional inferences for 860 total participants of ADNI with and without cerebral amyloidosis and clinical dementia ratings (CDR) ranging 0-3. Patterns for glucose metabolism were distinct in number and topography from patterns identified in previous studies of structural MRI. They were also distinct from well-establish topographies of resting-state neuronal networks mapped by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patterns for glucose metabolism identified significant topographical landmarks relating age, sex, APOE \u03b54 alleles, amyloidosis, CDR, and neurodegeneration. Patterns involving insular and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as midline regions of frontal and parietal lobes demonstrated the greatest neurodegeneration with progressive Alzheimer's dementia. A single pattern for the lateral parietal and posterior superior temporal cortices demonstrated preserved glucose metabolism for all diagnostic groups, including Alzheimer's dementia. Patterns correlated significantly with topical terms from the Neurosynth platform, thereby providing semantic representations for patterns such as attention, memory, language, fear/reward, movement and motor planning. In summary, NMF is a data-driven, principled, supervised statistical learning method that provides interpretable patterns of neurodegeneration. These patterns can help inform the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \u25aa Data-driven non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) identified 24 canonical patterns of spatial covariance of cerebral glucose metabolism. The training data comprised healthy older participants (CDR = 0 without amyloidosis) cross-sectionally drawn from ADNI. \u25aa In healthy participants, mean SUVRs for specific patterns in precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, and subcortical areas including superficial white matter and striatum, demonstrated increasing glucose metabolism with advancing age. \u25aa In asymptomatic participants with amyloidosis , glucose metabolism increased compared to those who were asymptomatic without amyloid , particularly in medial prefrontal cortex, frontoparietal cortex, occipital white, and posterior cerebellar regions. \u25aa In symptomatic participants with amyloidosis , insular cortex, medial frontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex demonstrated the most severe losses of glucose metabolism with increasing CDR.

In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of gamma stimulation in treating AD and delve into the possible mechanisms responsible for its positive effects. Recent studies reveal that it is feasible and safe to induce 40\u00a0Hz brain activity in AD patients through a range of 40\u00a0Hz multisensory and noninvasive electrical or magnetic stimulation methods. Although research into the clinical potential of these interventions is still in its nascent stages, these studies suggest that 40\u00a0Hz stimulation can yield beneficial effects on brain function, disease pathology, and cognitive function in individuals with AD. Specifically, we discuss studies involving 40\u00a0Hz light, auditory, and vibrotactile stimulation, as well as noninvasive techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation in AD are not yet fully elucidated, but preclinical studies have provided relevant insights. We discuss preclinical evidence related to both neuronal and nonneuronal mechanisms that may be involved, touching upon the relevance of interneurons, neuropeptides, and specific synaptic mechanisms in translating gamma stimulation into widespread neuronal activity within the brain. We also explore the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and the vasculature in mediating the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation on brain function.

Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the pathways linking APOE-\u03b54 to cognitive abilities through AD and non-AD neuropathology in an autopsy study with an admixed sample. Neuropathological lesions were evaluated following international criteria using immunohistochemistry.

In contrast, at late-stage chronic hypertension, they further exhibited elongated branches, thickened processes, and a reduced ramification index, mirroring the findings in human cSVD. An unbiased multidimensional flow cytometric analysis revealed phenotypic heterogeneity among microglia cells within the hippocampus and cortex. At early-stage hypertension, hippocampal microglia exhibited upregulated CD11b/c, P2Y12R, CD200R, and CD86 surface expression. Detailed analysis of cell subpopulations revealed a unique microglial subset expressing CD11b/c, CD163, and CD86 exclusively in early hypertension. Notably, even at early-stage hypertension, microglia displayed a higher association with cerebral blood vessels. We identified several profound clusters of microglia expressing distinct marker profiles at late chronic hypertensive states. In summary, our findings demonstrate a higher vulnerability of the hippocampus, stage-specific microglial signatures based on morphological features, and cell surface protein expression in response to chronic arterial hypertension. These results indicate the diversity within microglia sub-populations and implicate the subtle involvement of microglia in cSVD pathogenesis.",

A longitudinal cohort study using the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders, linked with other Swedish national registries. Cognitive trajectories evaluated with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) were compared between statin users and non-users, individual statin users, groups of statins and non-statin lipid-lowering medications using mixed-effect regression models with inverse probability of drop out weighting. A dose-response analysis included statin users compared to non-users. Our cohort consisted of 15,586 patients with mean age of 79.5 years at diagnosis and a majority of women (59.2 %). A dose-response effect was demonstrated: taking one defined daily dose of statins on average was associated with 0.63 more MMSE points after 3 years compared to no use of statins (95% CI: 0.33;0.94). Simvastatin users showed 1.01 more MMSE points (95% CI: 0.06;1.97) after 3 years compared to atorvastatin users. Younger (< 79.5 years at index date) simvastatin users had 0.80 more MMSE points compared to younger atorvastatin users (95% CI: 0.05;1.55) after 3 years. Simvastatin users had 1.03 more MMSE points (95% CI: 0.26;1.80) compared to rosuvastatin users after 3 years. No differences regarding statin lipophilicity were observed. The results of sensitivity analysis restricted to incident users were not consistent. Some patients with AD or mixed dementia with indication for lipid-lowering medication may benefit cognitively from statin treatment; however, further research is needed to clarify the findings of sensitivity analyses.",

        "AbstractText": "Enormous clinical and biomedical researches have demonstrated that microbes are crucial to human health. Identifying associations between microbes and diseases can not only reveal potential disease mechanisms, but also facilitate early diagnosis and promote precision medicine. Due to the data perturbation and unsatisfactory latent representation, there is a significant room for improvement. In this work, we proposed a novel framework, Multi-scale Variational Graph AutoEncoder embedding Wasserstein distance (MVGAEW) to predict disease-related microbes, which had the ability to resist data perturbation and effectively generate latent representations for both microbes and diseases from the perspective of distribution. First, we calculated multiple similarities and integrated them through similarity network confusion. Subsequently, we obtained node latent representations by improved variational graph autoencoder. Ultimately, XGBoost classifier was employed to predict potential disease-related microbes. We also introduced multi-order node embedding reconstruction to enhance the representation capacity. We also performed ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each section of our model. Moreover, we conducted experiments on common drugs and case studies, including Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, and colorectal neoplasms, to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Significantly, our model exceeded other currently state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting a great improvement on the HMDAD database.",

Associations have been noted between skin diseases and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Dementia is a neurological disorder of progressive cognitive impairment with increasing incidence among older adults. This study aimed to assess the potential associations between pemphigus, pemphigoid and AD in a large, nationally representative US cohort. All data of hospitalized patients aged 60\u2009years or older were extracted from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016-2018. Patients with a history of head trauma, diagnosis of vascular dementia, history of cerebrovascular disease, or malformation of cerebral vessels were excluded. The study population was divided into those with and without pemphigus (cohort 1) and with and without pemphigoid (cohort 2). Pemphigus was independently associated with a 69% increased risk of AD. Adults \u226580\u2009years old with pemphigus were 72% more likely to develop AD than adults without pemphigus. Women with pemphigus were 78% more likely to develop AD than women without pemphigus.

Females with pemphigoid were 63% more likely to have AD than those without pemphigoid. Moreover, Hispanic older adults with pemphigus were 3-times more likely to have AD than those without pemphigoid. Pemphigus and pemphigoid were both independently associated with AD in older adults, especially among females and octogenarians.

Moreover, the NPS were also associated with higher AD biomarkers (brain tau and amyloid burden) even in non-demented patients. But the effect of the relationship between NPS and biomarkers on cognitive decline has not yet been studied. This work aims to assess the relationship between longitudinal cognitive changes and NPS, specifically depression and anxiety, in association with AD biomarkers in healthy middle-aged to older participants. The cohort consisted of 101 healthy participants aged 50-70\u00a0years, 66 of whom had neuropsychological assessments of memory, executive functions, and global cognition at a 2-year follow-up. At baseline, NPS were assessed using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories while brain tau and amyloid loads were measured using positron emission topography. For tau burden, THK5351 uptake is used as a proxy of tau and neuroinflammation. Participants, declining or remaining stable at follow-up, were categorized into groups for each cognitive domain. Group classification was investigated using binary logistic regressions based on combined AD biomarkers and the two NPS. The results showed that an association between anxiety and prefrontal amyloid burden significantly classified episodic memory decline, while the classification of global cognitive decline involved temporal and occipital amyloid burden but not NPS. Moreover, depression together with prefrontal and hippocampal tau burden were associated with a decline in memory. The classification of participants based on executive decline was related to depression and mainly prefrontal tau burden. These findings suggest that the combination of NPS and brain biomarkers of AD predicts the occurrence of cognitive decline in aging.",

Perturbations in tau's structure and function are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies, the most common disorder of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). In tauopathies, it has been found that tau has a variety of post-translational modification (PTM) abnormalities and/or tau is cleaved into a variety of fragments by some specific proteolytic enzymes; however, the precise contributions of these abnormal modifications and fragments to disease onset and progression remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide an overview about the involvement of distinctive abnormal tau PTMs and different tau fragments in the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies and discuss the involvement of proteolytic enzymes such as caspases, calpains, and asparagine endopeptidase in mediating tau cleavage while also addressing the intercellular transmission role played by tau.

The phenomenal-behavior patterns may be deconstructed into basic dimensions, i.e., psychomotricity, affectivity, and thought, which might have distinct neural correlates. This work provides a data overview on the relationship of these phenomenal-behavioral dimensions with brain activity across physiological and pathological conditions (including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia). Accordingly, we propose a three-dimensional model of neural activity and phenomenal-behavioral patterns. In this model, neural activity is organized into distinct units in accordance with connectivity patterns and related input/output processing, manifesting in the different phenomenal-behavioral dimensions. (1) An external neural\u00a0unit, which involves the sensorimotor circuit/brain's sensorimotor network and is connected with the external environment, processes external inputs/outputs, manifesting in the psychomotor dimension (processing of exteroception/somatomotor activity). External unit hyperactivity manifests in psychomotor excitation (hyperactivity/hyperkinesia/catatonia), while external unit hypoactivity manifests in psychomotor inhibition (retardation/hypokinesia/catatonia). (2) An internal neural\u00a0unit, which involves the interoceptive-autonomic circuit/brain's salience network and is connected with the internal/body environment, processes internal inputs/outputs, manifesting in the affective dimension (processing of interoception/autonomic activity). Internal unit hyperactivity manifests in affective excitation (anxiety/dysphoria-euphoria/panic), while internal unit hypoactivity manifests in affective inhibition (anhedonia/apathy/depersonalization). (3) An associative neural\u00a0unit, which involves the brain's associative areas/default-mode network and is connected with the external/internal units (but not with the environment), processes associative inputs/outputs, manifesting in the thought dimension (processing of ideas). Associative unit hyperactivity manifests in thought excitation (mind-wandering/repetitive thinking/psychosis), while associative unit hypoactivity manifests in thought inhibition (inattention/cognitive deficit/consciousness loss). Finally, these neural units interplay and dynamically combine into various neural states, resulting in the complex phenomenal experience and behavior across physiology and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",

The gut microbiome is shaped at birth, while numerous genetic, dietary, and environmental variables primarily influence the microbiome composition. The importance of gut microbiota on host health is becoming more widely acknowledged. Digestion, intestinal permeability, and immunological and metabolism responses can all be affected by changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. There is mounting evidence that the microbial population's complex traits are important biomarkers and indicators of patient outcomes in cancer and its therapies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that changed commensal gut microorganisms contribute to the development and spread of cancer through various routes. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal cancer, accumulating evidence points to a potentially far more intricate connection than a simple cause-and-effect relationship. SIMPLE SUMMARY: Due to their high frequency and fatality rate, gastrointestinal cancers are regarded as a severe public health issue with complex medical and economic burdens. The gut microbiota may directly or indirectly interact with existing therapies like immunotherapy and chemotherapy, affecting how well a treatment works. The gut microbiome influences the immune response's activity, function, and development. Generally, certain gut bacteria impact the antitumor actions during cancer by creating particular metabolites or triggering T-cell responses. Yet, certain bacterial species have been found to promote cellular proliferation and metastasis in cancer, and comprehending these interactions in the context of cancer may help identify possible treatment targets. Notwithstanding the improvements in the field, additional research is still required to comprehend the underlying processes, examine the effects on existing therapies, and pinpoint certain bacteria and immune cells that can cause this interaction.",

One hundred twenty-nine-patients (99 aMCI-AD and 30 AD), and 42 healthy controls (HCs) (MMSE\u00a0=\u00a029.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0.8; age:69.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6 years; education:10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 years) who underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery including FCSRT and brain FDG-PET were enrolled. According to their clinical relevance and available sample sizes, SOMI-4 (N\u00a0=\u00a024 subjects; MMSE score:26.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6: age:75.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2; education:9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5) and SOMI-5 groups (N\u00a0=\u00a097; MMSE:25.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6; age:73.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8; education:9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1) were investigated. Compared to HCs, SOMI-4 showed hypometabolism in the precuneus, medial temporal gyrus bilaterally, right pecuneus and angular gyrus. SOMI-5 exhibited broader hypometabolism, extending to the left posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus bilaterally. The conjunction analysis revealed overlapping areas in the precuneus, medial temporal gyrus bilaterally, and in the right angular gyrus and cuneus. The disjunction analysis identified SOMI-5 specific hypometabolism encompassing left inferior temporal gyrus, uncus and parahippocampal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus bilaterally (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, p-value (FWE)\u00a0<\u00a0.05). SOMI-4 relates to posterior hypometabolism, while SOMI-5 to more extensive hypometabolism further encompassing frontal cortices, suggesting SOMI as a biologically relevant classification system of memory decline. Memory decline staged with SOMI is associated with hypometabolism spreading in amnesic MCI-AD/AD, suggesting its usefulness as a clinical marker of increasing neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Microflow liquid chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (\u03bcLC-MS/MS) is increasingly applied for high-throughput profiling of biological samples and has been proven to have an acceptable trade-off between sensitivity and reproducibility. However, lipidomics applications are scarce. We optimized a \u03bcLC-MS/MS system utilizing a 1 mm inner diameter \u00d7 100 mm column coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer to establish a sensitive, high-throughput, and robust single-shot lipidomics workflow. Compared to conventional lipidomics methods, we achieve a \u223c4-fold increase in response, facilitating quantification of 351 lipid species from a single iPSC-derived cerebral organoid during a 15 min LC-MS analysis. Consecutively, we injected 303 samples over \u223c75 h to prove the robustness and reproducibility of the microflow separation. As a proof of concept, \u03bcLC-MS/MS analysis of Alzheimer's disease patient-derived iPSC cerebral organoid reveals differential lipid metabolism depending on APOE phenotype (E3/3 vs E4/4). Microflow separation proves to be an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method as it reduces the consumption of harmful solvents. Also, the data demonstrate robust, in-depth, high-throughput performance to enable routine clinical or biomedical applications.",

We characterized prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) in LT recipients pre-LT and \u22653 months post-LT. Adult LT recipients with cirrhosis but without active pre-LT hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were screened for CI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for CI (MoCA\u00a0<24) both pre-LT and \u22653 months post-LT. The association between cognitive performance and recipient characteristics was assessed using logistic regression. Of 107 LT recipients, 36% had pre-LT CI and 27% had post-LT CI [median (Q1-Q3) MoCA 26 (23-28)]. Each 1-point increase in pre-LT MoCA was associated with 26% lower odds of post-LT cognitive impairment (aOR .74, 95% CI .63-.87, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), after adjusting for recipient age, history of HE, and time since LT. In this study of cirrhosis recipients without active pre-LT HE, cognitive impairment was prevalent before LT and remained prevalent \u22653 months after LT (27%), long after effects of portal hypertension on cognition would be expected to have resolved.

Six English and four Chinese databases were searched for relevant studies published up to January 2022. Randomized controlled trials of patients with poststroke cognitive impairment treated with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation were included. Included studies were assessed for the risk of bias through the Cochrane Intervention Systematic Review Manual 5.1.0. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed. Sixty-one randomized controlled trials (4012 patients) were included. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score, Mini-Mental State Examination score, event-related potential P300 (P300) amplitude, Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment score, and total effective rate of cognitive function were higher in the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the control group at the end of the treatment period, and scores of Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and P300 latency were lower in the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the control group. Fifty studies had selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as the stimulation site for high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Compared with nonrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation not only improves the overall cognitive function of poststroke cognitive impairment patients but also has better rehabilitation results.",

Additional studies are essential to better understand levels of dementia worry and its correlates, especially in cross-cultural contexts. To reach this goal, it is critical to use structured and valid measures to assess dementia worry and to verify these measures in different languages. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Modified Dementia Worry Scale (the H-MDWS).\u00a0A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted with 368 Israeli laypeople who were 18 years of age or older (53% women, 76% Jewish, mean age\u2009=\u200940, average years of education\u2009=\u200914). In addition to the H-MDWS, participants were asked to report their fear of Alzheimer's disease (using a dichotomous single item), stigma, health anxiety, and demographic characteristics.\u00a0Reliability analyses showed that the Cronbach's alpha for the H-MDWS was excellent (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.95). The results of the factor analysis demonstrated that the scale has a unidimensional structure, explaining over 66% of the variance. In addition, we found significant correlations between fear of developing Alzheimer's disease, stigma, and health anxiety, on the one hand, and the H-MDWS on the other.\u00a0The H-MDWS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing dementia worry. The validation of the tool not only allows expanding the body of knowledge related to dementia worry, but will also allow professionals and caregivers to identify people who are at risk of reporting dementia worry and develop interventions accordingly.",

However, the contribution of physical and cognitive functions to this relationship needs further examination. This study aims to examine the mediating effect of physical fitness and cognitive function in the relationship between independence in basic ADLs and QoL among older adults with dementia. This cross-sectional study included 107 older adults with dementia (74.8% women; age 78.21\u2009\u00b1\u20097.70\u00a0years). Independence in basic ADL and QoL were evaluated using the Barthel Index (BI) and QoL- Alzheimer's Disease Scale, respectively. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination were applied to assess cognitive function. Physical fitness was evaluated using the 30-s chair stand, 2-min step and the Timed-Up and Go tests. A structural equation modelling (SEM) with bootstrapping estimation was conducted to determine the relationship between all variables. Independence in basic ADL positively affected QoL and this association was mediated by physical fitness (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.242, p\u2009=\u20090.011). No statistically significant results were observed when testing cognitive function as a mediator between BI and QoL (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.009, p\u2009=\u20090.345). Physical fitness (i.e., lower body strength, aerobic capacity, and mobility) plays a role in the relationship between basic ADL independence and QoL of older adults with dementia, reinforcing the need to improve and monitor these parameters throughout the disease progression. Future longitudinal studies should explore the temporal relationship between physical and cognitive function and its contribution to basic ADL independence and QoL.",

The data source is the Helsinki part of the population-based FinEsS study on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases including information on age, education level, main occupation, sex, and tobacco smoking combined with death registry information. We compared estimated VGDF exposure to mortality using adjusted competing-risks regression for disease-specific survival analysis for a 24-year follow-up. Compared to the no-exposure group, the high occupational VGDF exposure group had sub-hazard ratios (sHR) of 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.2) for all cardiovascular-related and sHR 2.1 (1.5-3.9) for just coronary artery-related mortality. It also had sHR 1.7 (1.0-2.8) for Alzheimer's or vascular dementia-related mortality and sHR 1.7(1.2-2.4) for all respiratory disease-related mortality.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great potential for modulation of A\u03b2 self-assembly, which is nevertheless limited by the inefficient utilization of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, an erythrocyte membrane (EM)-modified core-shell upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP/Cur@EM) is designed and fabricated as a biomimetic nanobait to improve the PDT efficiency in AD. The UCNP with the outlayer of mesoporous silica is synthesized to load a high amount of the photosensitizer (curcumin), the unique optical feature of which can trigger curcumin to generate ROS upon near-infrared light (NIR) irradiation. Integration of EM enables the biomimetic nanobait to attract A\u03b2 peptides trapped in the phospholipid bilayer, restraining the growth of A\u03b2 monomers to form aggregates and improving the utilization rate of ROS to degrade the preformed A\u03b2 aggregates. In vivo studies demonstrate that UCNP/Cur@EM irradiated by NIR enables to decrease A\u03b2 deposits, ameliorates memory deficits, and rescues cognitive functions in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. A biocompatible and controllable way is provided here to inhibit the amyloid protein-associated pathological process of AD.",

It is also widely used by researchers examining the distribution and accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases including NP-C and Sanfilippo syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA; MPS IIIA). Recently, it has been suggested to be useful in studying Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Given filipin's susceptibility to photobleaching, we sought to establish a quantitative biochemical method for free cholesterol measurement. Brain tissue from mice with MPS IIIA was stained with filipin. Total and free cholesterol in brain homogenates was measured using a commercially available kit and a quantitative LC-MS/MS assay was developed. Gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3 were also quantified using LC-MS/MS. As anticipated, the MPS IIIA mouse brain displayed large numbers of filipin-positive intra-cytoplasmic inclusions, presumptively endo-lysosomes. Challenging the prevailing dogma, however, we found no difference in the amount of free cholesterol in MPS IIIA mouse brain homogenates cf. control tissue, using either the fluorometric kit or LC-MS/MS assay. Filipin has previously been reported to bind to GM1 ganglioside, however, this lipid does not accumulate in MPS IIIA cells/tissues. Using a fluorometric assay, we demonstrate for the first time that filipin cross-reacts with both GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, explaining the filipin-reactive inclusions observed in MPS IIIA brain cells. Filipin is not specific for free cholesterol, and positive staining in any setting should be interpreted with caution.",

However, the role of 2'-FL and HMO in gut microbiota modulation in relation to AD remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to elucidate the preventive effect of the 2'-FL and HMO impact of AD and the relevant mechanism involved. Here, the behavioral results showed that 2'-FL and HMO intervention decreased the expression of Tau phosphorylation and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), inhibited neuroinflammation, and restored cognitive impairment in AD mice. The metagenomic analysis proved that 2'-FL and HMO intervention restored the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in AD. Notably, 2'-FL and HMO intervention significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Clostridium and Akkermansia. The metabolomics results showed that 2'-FL and HMO enhanced the oleoyl-l-carnitine metabolism as potential drivers. More importantly, the levels of oleoyl-l-carnitine were positively correlated with the abundances of Clostridium and Akkermansia.

Further analysis showed that secondary stressors played a predominant role in the increase in mental health difficulties. The main secondary stressors were loneliness, negative emotionality associated with the perception of COVID-19 disease, lack of resilience, female gender and younger age. The surge in stress levels and depressive symptoms persisted across all three consecutive COVID-19 waves. This persistence is attributable to the effects of secondary stressors, and particularly to the status of mental health before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Exercise promotes muscle, mitochondria, and cognitive health and is proposed to be a potential therapeutic for AD, but no study has investigated how skeletal muscle adapts to exercise training in an AD-like context. Utilizing 5xFAD mice, an AD model that develops ad-like pathology and cognitive impairments around 6\u2009mo of age, we examined in vivo neuromuscular function and exercise adapations (mitochondrial respiration and RNA sequencing) before the manifestation of overt cognitive impairment. We found 5xFAD mice develop neuromuscular dysfunction beginning as early as 4\u2009mo of age, characterized by impaired nerve-stimulated muscle torque production and compound nerve action potential of the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, skeletal muscle in 5xFAD mice had altered, sex-dependent, adaptive responses (mitochondrial respiration and gene expression) to exercise training in the absence of overt cognitive impairment. Changes in peripheral systems, specifically neural communication to skeletal muscle, may be harbingers for AD and have implications for lifestyle interventions, like exercise, in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive dementia. Research suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Reduced levels of miR-137 have been observed in the brains of AD patients, but its specific role and downstream mechanisms remain unclear. This study sought to examine the therapeutic potential of miR-137-5p agomir in alleviating cognitive dysfunction induced in AD models and explore its potential mechanisms. This study utilized bioinformatic analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay to investigate the relationship between miR-137-5p and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 (USP30). In\u00a0vitro experiments were conducted using SH-SY5Y cells to assess the impact of miR-137-5p on A\u03b21-42 neurotoxicity. In\u00a0vivo experiments on AD mice evaluated the effects of miR-137-5p on cognition, A\u03b21-42 deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal apoptosis, as well as its influence on USP30 levels. It was discovered that miR-137-5p mimics efficiently counteract A\u03b21-42 neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a protective effect that is negated by USP30 overexpression. In\u00a0vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-137-5p enhances the cognition and mobility of AD mice, significantly reducing A\u03b21-42 deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal apoptosis within the hippocampus and cortex regions. Mechanistically, miR-137-5p significantly suppresses USP30 levels in mice, though USP30 overexpression partially buffers against miR-137-5p-induced AD symptom improvement. Our study proposes that miR-137-5p, by instigating the downregulation of USP30, has the potential to act as a novel and promising therapeutic target for AD.",

The increased risk of developing this syndrome resulting from established modifiable risk factors, such as depressive episodes, is currently a subject of interest. The aim of this study was to review the scientific evidence that addresses the relationship between depression and dementia. A bibliographic search of the PubMed and PsycInfo databases for articles published over the past 20 years was conducted with the following medical subject heading terms: depression or depressive, dementia, and incidence or cohort studies. After articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected, relevant moderating variables were grouped as sample characteristics, methodological characteristics, extrinsic characteristics, and outcome variables. The 26 selected studies resulted in a sample comprising 1,760,262 individuals. Statistical analysis revealed a pooled relative risk for the development of dementia of 1.82 (95% CI=1.62-2.06). The primary variables evaluated were the diagnostic methods for depression and dementia and the presence of depression. Other variables, such as mean age, methodological quality of each study, follow-up time, and publication year, were also evaluated. Age was statistically but not clinically significant. No relevant publication bias or alterations in the results were found when accounting for the quality of the studies.

        "AbstractText": "Modifiable lifestyle behaviors account for a large proportion of dementia risk. However, the combined contributions of multidomain lifestyle patterns to cognitive aging are poorly understood, as most studies have examined individual lifestyle behaviors in isolation and without neuropathological characterization. This study examined data-driven patterns of lifestyle behaviors across multiple domains among older adults and tested their associations with disease-specific neuropathological burden and cognitive decline. Participants included 2059 older adults enrolled in the longitudinal Memory and Aging Project (MAP) at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center; none of whom had dementia at baseline (73% no cognitive impairment (NCI), 27% mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). All participants completed cognitive testing annually. Lifestyle factors were measured during at least one visit and included (1) actigraphy-measured physical activity, as well as self-reported (2) sleep quality, (3) life space, (4) cognitive activities, (5) social activities, and (6) social network. A subset of participants (n = 791) had autopsy data for which burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis/TDP-43 was measured. Latent profile analysis across all 2059 participants identified distinct subgroups (i.e., classes) of lifestyle patterns. Linear mixed-effects models examined relationships between lifestyle classes and global cognitive trajectories, with and without covarying for all neuropathologies. Classes were also compared on rates of incident MCI/dementia. Five classes were identified: Class 1Low Life Space (lowest lifestyle engagement), Class 2PA (high physical activity), Class 3Low Avg (low to average lifestyle engagement), Class 4Balanced (high average lifestyle engagement), and Class 5Social (large social network). Classes 4Balanced and 5Social had the lowest AD burden, and Class 2PA had the lowest CVD burden. Classes 2-5 had significantly less steep global cognitive decline compared to Class 1Low Life Space, with comparable effect sizes before and after covarying for neuropathological burden. Classes 4Balanced and 5Social exhibited the lowest rates of incident MCI/dementia. Lifestyle behavior patterns among older adults account for differential rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression. Those with at least average engagement across all lifestyle domains exhibit greater cognitive stability after adjustment for neuropathology, highlighting the importance of engagement in multiple healthy lifestyle behaviors for later life cognitive health.",

        "AbstractText": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain immune tolerance. While Treg-mediated neuroprotective activities are now well-accepted, the lack of defined antigen specificity limits their therapeutic potential. This is notable for neurodegenerative diseases where cell access to injured brain regions is required for disease-specific therapeutic targeting and improved outcomes. To address this need, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) antigen specificity was conferred to Treg responses by engineering the T cell receptor (TCR) specific for A\u03b2 (TCRA\u03b2). The TCRAb were developed from disease-specific T cell effector (Teff) clones. The ability of Tregs expressing a transgenic TCRA\u03b2 (TCRA\u03b2 -Tregs) to reduce A\u03b2 burden, transform effector to regulatory cells, and reverse disease-associated neurotoxicity proved beneficial in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. TCRA\u03b2 -Tregs were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of endogenous TCR and consequent incorporation of the transgenic TCRAb identified from A\u03b2 reactive Teff monoclones. Antigen specificity was confirmed by MHC-A\u03b2-tetramer staining. Adoptive transfer of TCRA\u03b2-Tregs to mice expressing a chimeric mouse-human amyloid precursor protein and a mutant human presenilin-1 followed measured behavior, immune, and immunohistochemical outcomes. TCRA\u03b2-Tregs expressed an A\u03b2-specific TCR. Adoptive transfer of TCRA\u03b2-Tregs led to sustained immune suppression, reduced microglial reaction, and amyloid loads. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose radiolabeled TCRA\u03b2-Treg homed to the brain facilitating antigen specificity.

        "AbstractText": "\"Brain-predicted age\" estimates biological age from complex, nonlinear features in neuroimaging scans. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), but is underexplored in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), in which AD progression is highly predictable with minimal confounding age-related co-pathology. We modeled BAG in 257 deeply-phenotyped ADAD mutation-carriers and 179 non-carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network using minimally-processed structural MRI scans. We then tested whether BAG differed as a function of mutation and cognitive status, or estimated years until symptom onset, and whether it was associated with established markers of amyloid (PiB PET, CSF amyloid-\u03b2-42/40), phosphorylated tau (CSF and plasma pTau-181), neurodegeneration (CSF and plasma neurofilament-light-chain [NfL]), and cognition (global neuropsychological composite and CDR-sum of boxes). We compared BAG to other MRI measures, and examined heterogeneity in BAG as a function of ADAD mutation variants, APOE\u00a0\u03b54 carrier status, sex, and education. Advanced brain aging was observed in mutation-carriers approximately 7 years before expected symptom onset, in line with other established structural indicators of atrophy. BAG was moderately associated with amyloid PET and strongly associated with pTau-181, NfL, and cognition in mutation-carriers. Mutation variants, sex, and years of education contributed to variability in BAG. We extend prior work using BAG from sporadic AD to ADAD, noting consistent results. BAG associates well with markers of pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition, but to a lesser extent, amyloid, in ADAD. BAG may capture similar signal to established MRI measures. However, BAG offers unique benefits in simplicity of data processing and interpretation. Thus, results in this unique ADAD cohort with few age-related confounds suggest that brain aging attributable to AD neuropathology can be accurately quantified from minimally-processed MRI.",

        "AbstractText": "Autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease (PD). The most common mutation, G2019S-LRRK2, increases the kinase activity of LRRK2 causing hyper-phosphorylation of its substrates. One of these substrates, Rab10, is phosphorylated at a conserved Thr73 residue (pRab10), and is one of the most abundant LRRK2 Rab GTPases expressed in various tissues. The involvement of Rab10 in neurodegenerative disease, including both PD and Alzheimer's disease makes pinpointing the cellular and subcellular localization of Rab10 and pRab10 in the brain an important step in understanding its functional role, and how post-translational modifications could impact function. To establish the specificity of antibodies to the phosphorylated form of Rab10 (pRab10), Rab10 specific antisense oligonucleotides were intraventricularly injected into the brains of mice. Further, Rab10 knock out induced neurons, differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to test the pRab10 antibody specificity. To amplify the weak immunofluorescence signal of pRab10, tyramide signal amplification was utilized. Rab10 and pRab10 were expressed in the cortex, striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta. Immunofluorescence for pRab10 was increased in G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice. Neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes all showed Rab10 and pRab10 expression. While Rab10 colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome and trans-Golgi network markers, pRab10 did not localize to these organelles. However, pRab10, did overlap with markers of the presynaptic terminal in both mouse and human cortex, including \u03b1-synuclein. Results from this study suggest Rab10 and pRab10 are expressed in all brain areas and cell types tested in this study, but pRab10 is enriched at the presynaptic terminal. As Rab10 is a LRRK2 kinase substrate, increased kinase activity of G2019S-LRRK2 in PD may affect Rab10 mediated membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal in neurons in disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Machine learning (ML) has increasingly been used to assist and expand current practices in neuropathology. However, generating large imaging datasets with quality labels is challenging in fields which demand high levels of expertise. Further complicating matters is the often seen disagreement between experts in neuropathology-related tasks, both at the case level and at a more granular level. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer disease, and are associated with disease progression which warrants further investigation and granular quantification at a scale not currently accessible in routine human assessment. In this work, we first provide a baseline of annotator/rater agreement for the tasks of Braak NFT staging between experts and NFT detection using both experts and novices in neuropathology. We use a whole-slide-image (WSI) cohort of neuropathology cases from Emory University Hospital immunohistochemically stained for Tau. We develop a workflow for gathering annotations of the early stage formation of NFTs (Pre-NFTs) and mature intracellular (iNFTs) and show\u00a0ML models can be trained to learn annotator nuances for the task of NFT detection in WSIs. We utilize a model-assisted-labeling approach and demonstrate ML models can be used to aid in labeling large datasets efficiently. We also show these models can be used to extract case-level features, which predict Braak NFT stages comparable to expert human raters, and do so at scale. This study provides a generalizable workflow for various pathology and related fields, and also provides a technique for accomplishing a high-level neuropathology task with limited human annotations.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) as a complementary intervention in treating cognitive impairment has significantly increased. VR applications based on instrumental activities of daily living (iADL-VR) could offer a promising approach with greater ecological validity for intervention in groups with cognitive impairments. However, the effectiveness of this approach is still debated. This systematic review aims to synthesize the effects of iADL-VR interventions to rehabilitate, train, or stimulate cognitive functions in healthy adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and different types of dementia. A systematic search was performed in the Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and APA PsycNet databases until September 2022 and repeated in April 2023. The selected studies met the search terms, were peer-reviewed, included an iADL-VR intervention, and were written in English. Descriptive, qualitative studies, reviews, cognitive assessment, non-intervention studies, those unrelated to VR or iADL, those focused on motor aspects, and non-degenerative disorders were excluded. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the controlled studies. To present and synthesize the results, we organized the extracted data into three tables, including PEDro scores, participant characteristics, and study characteristics. Nineteen studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The total sample reached 590 participants, mostly women (72.67%). Approximately 30% were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, and 20% had mild cognitive impairment. Variables such as authors and year of publication, study design, type of intervention and VR applied, duration of the intervention, main findings, and conclusions were extracted. Regarding demographic characteristics, the sample size, age, sex, years of education, neurological diagnosis, dropouts, and the city and country where the intervention took place were recorded. Almost all studies showed improvements in some or all the outcomes after the intervention, generally greater in the iADL-VR group than in the control group. iADL-VR interventions could be beneficial in improving the performance of cognitive functions in older adults and people with MCI and different types of dementia. The ecological component of these tasks makes them very suitable for transferring what has been learned to the real world. However, such transfer needs to be confirmed by further studies with larger and more homogeneous samples and longer follow-up periods.

        "AbstractText": "Inflammasomes in astrocytes have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabinoid Receptor 2(CB2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is considered a promising therapeutic target in inflammation-related disorders. This study aims to explore the role of CB2R in regulating NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated neuroinflammation in astrocytes. In an in vivo animal model, specific targeting of astrocytic CB2R was achieved by injecting CB2R-specific adenovirus (or fork head box g1(foxg1) adenovirus) to knock down CB2R or administering CB2R agonists, inhibitors, etc., in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of mice. A PD mouse model was established using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induction. Animal behavioral tests, western blot, immunofluorescence, and other experiments were performed to assess the loss of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons, activation of astrocytes, and activation of the NLRP3 pathway. Primary astrocytes were cultured in vitro, and NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Western blot and ELISA experiments were conducted to assess the release of inflammatory factors. Transcriptomic sequencing and CUT&RUN techniques were employed to study the CB2R regulation of the foxg1 binding site on the autophagy molecule microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B). Astrocytic CB2R knockdown impaired the motor abilities of MPTP-induced mice, exacerbated the loss of TH neurons, and induced activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/interleukin 1 (IL-1\u03b2) pathway. Activation of CB2R significantly alleviated motor impairments in mice while reducing NLRP3 deposition on astrocytes. In vitro cell experiments showed that CB2R activation attenuated the activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 pathway induced by LPS\u2009+\u2009ATP or MPP+. Additionally, it inhibited the binding of foxg1 to MAP1LC3B, increased astrocytic autophagy levels, and facilitated NLRP3 degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Activation of CB2R on astrocytes effectively mitigates NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation and ameliorates the disease characteristics of PD in mice.

The pathologic hallmarks of AD include tau neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaque depositions in the hippocampus and associated neocortex. The neuronal aggregated tau observed in AD cells suggests that the protein folding problem is a major cause of AD. J-domain-containing proteins (JDPs) are the largest family of cochaperones, which play a vital role in specifying and directing HSP70 chaperone functions. JDPs bind substrates and deliver them to HSP70. The association of JDP and HSP70 opens the substrate-binding domain of HSP70 to help the loading of the clients. However, in the initial HSP70 cycle, which JDP delivers tau to the HSP70 system in neuronal cells remains unclear. We screened the requirement of a diverse panel of JDPs for preventing tau aggregation in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y by a filter retardation method. Interestingly, knockdown of DNAJB6, one of the JDPs, displayed tau aggregation and overexpression of DNAJB6b, one of the isoforms generated from the DNAJB6 gene by alternative splicing, reduced tau aggregation. Further, the tau bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay confirmed the DNAJB6b-dependent tau clearance. The co-immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation assay demonstrated the protein-protein interaction between tau and the chaperone-cochaperone complex. The J-domain of DNAJB6b was critical for preventing tau aggregation. Moreover, reduced DNAJB6 expression and increased tau aggregation were detected in an age-dependent manner in immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus tissues of a mouse model of tau pathology. In summary, downregulation of DNAJB6b increases the insoluble form of tau, while overexpression of DNAJB6b reduces tau aggregation. Moreover, DNAJB6b associates with tau. Therefore, this study reveals that DNAJB6b is a direct sensor for its client tau in the HSP70 folding system in neuronal cells, thus helping to prevent AD.",

Our earlier published data indicated that the mice performed better than controls on the Morris Maze Test parallel with decreased occurrence of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques in the hippocampus. We investigated the neuroprotective and therapeutic effects of high-intensity training and postbiotic supplementation. Thirty-two adult APP/PS1TG mice were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) high-intensity training (3) postbiotic, (4) combined (training and postbiotic) treatment for 20 weeks. In this study, the whole hemibrain without hippocampus was used to find molecular traits explaining improved brain function. We applied qualitative RT-PCR for gene expression, Western blot for protein level, and Zymography for LONP1 activity. Disaggregation analysis of A\u03b2-40 was performed in the presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum lysate. We found that exercise training decreased Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related gene expression (NF-kB) that was not affected by postbiotic treatment. The preparation used for postbiotic treatment is composed of tyndallized Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Both of the postbiotics effectively disaggregated amyloid-\u03b2/A\u03b2-40 aggregates by chelating Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions. The postbiotic treatment decreased endogenous human APPTG protein expression and mouse APP gene expression in the hemibrains. In addition, the postbiotic treatment elevated mitochondrial LONP1 activity as well. Our findings revealed distinct mechanisms behind improved memory performance in the whole brain: while exercise training modulates NF-kB signaling pathway regulating immune response until postbiotic diminishes APP gene expression, disaggregates pre-existing amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and activates mitochondrial protein quality control in the region of brain out of hippocampus.

This study aims to determine the differences in aperiodic activity between AD and FTD and evaluate its potential for distinguishing between the two disorders. A total of 88 participants, including 36 patients with AD, 23 patients with FTD, and 29 healthy controls (CN) underwent cognitive assessment and scalp EEG acquisition. Neuronal power spectra were parameterized to decompose the EEG spectrum, enabling comparison of group differences in different components. A support vector machine was employed to assess the impact of aperiodic parameters on the differential diagnosis. Compared with the CN group, both the AD and FTD groups showed varying degrees of increased alpha power (both periodic and raw power) and theta alpha power ratio. At the channel level, theta power (both periodic and raw power) in the frontal regions was higher in the AD group compared to the FTD group, and aperiodic parameters (both exponents and offsets) in the frontal, temporal, central, and parietal regions were higher in the AD group than in the FTD group. Importantly, the inclusion of aperiodic parameters led to improved performance in distinguishing between the two disorders.

This study aims to understand the experience of caregivers of people with dementia in Indonesia and better understanding of the stigma associated with dementia. This qualitative study is embedded within the Strengthening Responses to Dementia in Developing Countries project. Focus Group Discussions were held with dementia caregivers residing in Jakarta, Indonesia. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. Nineteen caregivers of people with dementia participated in the Focus Group Discussions. Themes identified included: (1) Understanding of dementia, (2) Reaction to care, and (3) Seeking a diagnosis. A perceived lack of understanding about dementia amongst the caregivers, ultimately shaped caregivers experience of care. This included negative reactions to care leading to internalised stigma (e.g., fear and shame). Misconceptions that dementia was due to spiritual and mystical reasons were particularly stigmatising. In Indonesia, families are providing care to people with dementia in an environment in which there is a lack of understanding that can lead to misdiagnosis, feelings of fear and shame. Efforts to raise address stigma and misunderstanding among the general public and healthcare professionals could be of particular value to support people with dementia and reduce the fear and shame that they can experience.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Self-supervised multimodal learning for group inferences from MRI data: Discovering disorder-relevant brain regions and multimodal links.",
        "AbstractText": "In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained significant attention in predicting brain disorders using neuroimaging data. However, conventional methods often rely on single-modality data and supervised models, which provide only a limited perspective of the intricacies of the highly complex brain. Moreover, the scarcity of accurate diagnostic labels in clinical settings hinders the applicability of the supervised models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for extracting multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance group inferences and enable analysis without resorting to labeled data during pre-training. Our approach leverages Deep InfoMax (DIM), a self-supervised methodology renowned for its efficacy in learning representations by estimating mutual information without the need for explicit labels. While DIM has shown promise in predicting brain disorders from single-modality MRI data, its potential for multimodal data remains untapped. This work extends DIM to multimodal neuroimaging data, allowing us to identify disorder-relevant brain regions and explore multimodal links. We present compelling evidence of the efficacy of our multimodal DIM analysis in uncovering disorder-relevant brain regions, including the hippocampus, caudate, insula, - and multimodal links with the thalamus, precuneus, and subthalamus hypothalamus. Our self-supervised representations demonstrate promising capabilities in predicting the presence of brain disorders across a spectrum of Alzheimer's phenotypes. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods based on autoencoders, canonical correlation analysis, and supervised models highlight the superiority of our proposed method in achieving improved classification performance, capturing joint information, and interpretability capabilities. The computational efficiency of the decoder-free strategy enhances its practical utility, as it saves compute resources without compromising performance. This work offers a significant step forward in addressing the challenge of understanding multimodal links in complex brain disorders, with potential applications in neuroimaging research and clinical diagnosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Epidemiological studies have shown that cigarette smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer disease. However, inconsistent results have been reported regarding the effects of smoking or nicotine on brain amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition. In this study, we found that stimulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) increased A\u03b2 production in mouse brains and cultured neuronal cells. nAChR activation triggered the MEK/ERK pathway, which then phosphorylated and stabilized nuclear SP1. Upregulated SP1 acted on two recognition motifs in the BACE1 gene to induce its transcription, resulting in enhanced A\u03b2 production. Mouse brain microdialysis revealed that nAChR agonists increased A\u03b2 levels in the interstitial fluid of the cerebral cortex but caused no delay of A\u03b2 clearance. In vitro assays indicated that nicotine inhibited A\u03b2 aggregation. We also found that nicotine modified the immunoreactivity of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies, possibly through competitive inhibition and A\u03b2 conformation changes. Using anti-A\u03b2 antibody that was carefully selected to avoid these effects, we found that chronic nicotine treatment in A\u03b2 precursor protein knockin mice increased the A\u03b2 content but did not visibly change the aggregated A\u03b2 deposition in the brain. Thus, nicotine influences brain A\u03b2 deposition in the opposite direction, thereby increasing A\u03b2 production and inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation.",

Understanding the structures of A\u03b2 oligomers is important for delineating the mechanism of A\u03b2 aggregation and developing effective therapeutics. Here, we use site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to study A\u03b242 oligomers prepared by using the protocol of A\u03b2-derived diffusible ligands. We obtained the EPR spectra of 37 A\u03b242 oligomer samples, each spin-labeled at a unique residue position of the A\u03b242 sequence. Analysis of the disordered EPR components shows that the N-terminal region has a lower local structural stability. Spin label mobility analysis reveals three structured segments at residues 9-11, 15-22, and 30-40. Intermolecular spin-spin interactions indicate a parallel in-register \u03b2-sheet structure, with residues 34-38 forming the structural core. Residues 16-21 also adopt the parallel in-register \u03b2-structure, albeit with weaker intermolecular packing.

Each eSAGE question was scored and behavioral features (metadata) such as the time spent on each test page, drawing speed, and average stroke length were extracted for each patient. Logistic regression (LR) and gradient boosting models were trained using these features to detect cognitive impairment (CI). Performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) score as evaluation metrics. LR with feature selection achieved an AUC of 89.51%, a recall of 87.56%, and an F1 of 85.07% using both behavioral and scoring. LR using scores and metadata also achieved an AUC of 84.00% in detecting MCI from NC, and an AUC of 98.12% in detecting DM from NC. Average stroke length was particularly useful for prediction and when combined with 4 other scoring features, LR achieved an even better AUC of 92.06% in detecting CI.

        "AbstractText": "The aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides has been confirmed to be associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the three phases of A\u03b2 aggregation, the lag phase has been considered to be the best time for early A\u03b2 pathological deposition clinical intervention and prevention for potential patients with normal cognition. A\u03b2 peptide exists in various lengths in vivo, and A\u03b2 oligomer in the early lag phase is neurotoxic but polymorphous and metastable, depending on A\u03b2 length (isoform), molecular weight, and specific phase, and therefore hardly characterized experimentally. To cope with the problem, molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the aggregation process of five monomers for each of the seven common A\u03b2 isoforms during the lag phase. Results showed that A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-38) monomers aggregated faster than their truncated analogues A\u03b2(4-40) and A\u03b2(4-38), respectively. However, the aggregation rate of A\u03b2(1-42) was slower than that of its truncated analogues A\u03b2(4-42) rather than that of A\u03b2pe(3-42). More importantly, A\u03b2(1-38) is first predicted as more likely to form stable hexamer than the remaining five A\u03b2 isoforms, as A\u03b2(1-42) does. It is hydrophobic interaction mainly (>50%) from the interfacial \u03b21 and \u03b22 regions of two reactants, pentamer and monomer, aggregated by A\u03b2(1-38)/A\u03b2(1-42) rather than by other A\u03b2 isoforms, that drives the hexamer stably as a result of the formation of the effective hydrophobic collapse. This paper provides new insights into the aggregation characteristics of A\u03b2 with different lengths and the conditions necessary for A\u03b2 to form oligomers with a high molecular weight in the early lag phase, revealing the dependence of A\u03b2 hexamer formation on the specific interfacial interaction.",

From a drug design perspective, natural products (NPs) are more drug-like and are highly compatible with biological systems compared to most synthetic libraries. NPs provide a more efficient and cost-effective approach to new drug discovery. However, the complexity of NPs makes their identification a challenging task. Chimgin, a bicyclic monoterpene with three chiral centers, exhibits a wide range of biological activity. Despite this, the exact structure of chimgin has remained unclear until now. In this study, we quantified the amount of chimgin in Ferula haussknechtii using analytical Reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detector (RP-HPLC-PDA). Furthermore, we determined the absolute configuration of chimgin through electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Finally, we evaluated its inhibitory effect on AChE through in\u00a0vitro and in silico studies.

The TSP is of interest not only in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering, but also in cognitive and behavioral research to study problem-solving and spatial navigation. Humans are able to complete even complex TSPs with a high degree of efficiency, and distance minimization in TSP analogs has been observed in a variety of nonhuman species as well. Tasks based on the TSP also have the potential for translational research on cognitive and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The current experiment was designed to examine the effects of target number on TSP performance in rats. After pretraining, rats were tested once on each of several target configurations, and their travel routes were recorded. We examined the routes for general efficiency, as well as evidence for strategy use including the nearest neighbor (NN) strategy and crossing avoidance. Our results indicate that latency and route length increase in proportion to the number of targets. Rats also showed a strong tendency to avoid path crossing, and to select NN targets, which strengthened with increasing target numbers. Taken together, our results indicate that travel efficiency decreases linearly in relation to the target number rather than the number of possible routes, which grows factorially with a target number. Additionally, spatial memory and route selection strategy are also affected by an increasing number of targets. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

Synaptosomes were analyzed with micrograph images, and protein and mRNA levels of ferroptotic markers were determined. Betaine and BA pretreatments did not cause any morphological and biochemical differences in the brain tissue. However, A\u03b2 (1-42) administration in synaptosomes increased the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member-4 (ACSL4), transferrin receptor-1 protein (TfR1), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and decreased the levels glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4) and glutathione (GSH). Moreover, ACSL4, GPx4, and TfR1 mRNA and protein levels were similar to the ELISA results. In contrast, betaine and BA pretreatments decreased the levels of ACSL4, TfR1, MDA, and 8-OHdG in synaptosomes incubated with A\u03b21-42, while promoting increased levels of GPx4 and GSH. In addition, betaine and BA pretreatments completely reversed ACSL4, GPx4, and TfR1 mRNA and protein levels.

For this purpose, synthetic compounds of oxadiazole derivatives (15-35) were evaluated and identified as promising inhibitors of AChE, exhibiting IC50 varying between 41.87 \u00b1 0.67 and 1580.25 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM. The kinetic parameters indicated that all the studied compounds bind to the allosteric site and decrease the efficiency of the AChE enzyme. In silico docking analysis showed that the majority of the compounds interact with the anionic subsite and Per-Arnt-Sim domain of AChE and are stabilized by various bonds including \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrogen bonding. The stability of the most potent compounds 16 and 17 with AChE interaction was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, all compounds exhibited concentration-dependent calcium (Ca2+) antagonistic and spasmolytic activities. Among the whole series of oxadiazole derivatives, compounds 16 and 17 displayed the highest activities on spontaneous and potassium (K+)-induced contraction.

Presently, only symptomatic treatments are available and no disease-modifying drugs are available for AD and other NDs. Thus, targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation with anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants has recently been given much focus. Now, flavonoids are being increasingly investigated as therapeutic agents to treat inflammation; apigenin has a neuroprotective effect. Iron dyshomeostasis plays a key role in sustaining the neuroinflammatory phenotype, highlighting the importance of maintaining iron balance, in which human transferrin (HTF) plays a vital role in this aspect. Herein, we explored the binding and dynamics of the HTF-apigenin complex using multifaceted computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking revealed that apigenin occupies the iron-binding pocket of HTF, forming hydrogen bonds with critical residues Arg475 and Thr686. Molecular dynamics simulations deciphered a dynamic view of the HTF-apigenin complex's behavior (300 ns) and suggested that the complex maintained a relatively stable conformation. The results of spectroscopic observations delineated significant binding of apigenin with HTF and stable HTF-apigenin complex formation. The observed binding mechanism and conformational stability could pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies to target neuroinflammation by apigenin in the context of iron homeostasis.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are characterized by abnormal functional connectivity (FC) of default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Static FC (sFC) and dynamic FC (dFC) combined with triple network model can better study the dynamic and static changes of brain networks, and improve its potential diagnostic value in the diagnosis of AD spectrum disorders. Differences in sFC values and dFC variability patterns among the three brain networks of the three groups (53 AD patients, 40 aMCI patients, and 40 NCs) were computed by ANOVA using Gaussian Random Field theory (GRF) correction. The correlation between FC values (sFC values and dFC variability) in the three networks and cognitive scores (MMSE and MoCA) in AD and aMCI groups was analyzed separately. Within the DMN network, there were significant differences of sFC values in right/left medial superior frontal gyrus and dFC variability in left opercular part inferior frontal gyrus and right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus among the three groups. Within the CEN network, there were significant differences of sFC values in left superior parietal gyrus. Within the SN network, there were significant differences of dFC variability in right Cerebelum_7b and left opercular part inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between FC values (sFC values of CEN and dFC variability of SN) and MMSE and MoCA scores. It suggests that sFC, dFC combined with triple network model can be considered as potential biomarkers for AD and aMCI.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to evaluate morphological changes in cortical and subcortical regions and their asymmetrical differences in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These morphological changes may provide valuable insights into the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted structural MRI scans on a cohort comprising 62 SCD patients, 97 MCI patients, and 70 age-, sex-, and years of education-matched healthy controls (HC). Using Freesurfer, we quantified surface area, thickness, the local gyrification index (LGI) of cortical regions, and the volume of subcortical nuclei. Asymmetry measures were also calculated. Additionally, we explored the correlation between morphological changes and clinical variables related to cognitive decline. Compared to HC, patients with MCI exhibited predominantly left-sided surface morphological changes in various brain regions, including the transverse temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and pars opercularis. SCD patients showed relatively minor surface morphological changes, primarily in the insula and pars triangularis. Furthermore, MCI patients demonstrated reduced volumes in the anterior-superior region of the right hypothalamus, the fimbria of the bilateral hippocampus, and the anterior region of the left thalamus. These observed morphological changes were significantly associated with clinical ratings of cognitive decline. The findings of this study suggest that cortical and subcortical morphometric changes may contribute to cognitive impairment in MCI, while compensatory mechanisms may be at play in SCD to preserve cognitive function. These insights have the potential to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase widely expressed in various tissues and organs. Unlike other kinases, GSK-3 is active under resting conditions and is inactivated upon stimulation. In mammals, GSK-3 includes GSK-3 \u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 isoforms encoded by two homologous genes, namely, GSK3A and GSK3B. GSK-3\u03b2 is essential for the control of glucose metabolism, signal transduction, and tissue homeostasis. As more than 100 known proteins have been identified as GSK-3\u03b2 substrates, it is sometimes referred to as a moonlighting kinase. Previous studies have elucidated the regulation modes of GSK-3\u03b2. GSK-3\u03b2 is involved in almost all aspects of brain functions, such as neuronal morphology, synapse formation, neuroinflammation, and neurological disorders. Recently, several comparatively specific small molecules have facilitated the chemical manipulation of this enzyme within cellular systems, leading to the discovery of novel inhibitors for GSK-3\u03b2. Despite these advancements, the therapeutic significance of GSK-3\u03b2 as a drug target is still complicated by uncertainties surrounding the potential of inhibitors to stimulate tumorigenesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate mechanisms of this enzyme and evaluates the existing evidence regarding the therapeutic potential of GSK-3\u03b2 in brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, and glioblastoma.",

        "AbstractText": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3-NPs) are small magnetic particles that are widely used in different aspects of biology and medicine in modern life. Fe2O3-NP accumulated in the living cells due to the absence of an active system to excrete the iron ions and damages cellular organelles by high reactivity. Herein cytotoxic effects of Fe2O3-NP with a size of 50 nm on the primary culture of neonatal rat hippocampus were investigated using 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Pathophysiological signs of Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, A\u03b2 aggregation, soluble APP\u03b1, and APP\u03b2 secretion were also investigated in hippocampal cells treated with various concentrations of nanoparticle (NP) for different exposure times. Our results revealed that Fe2O3-NP treatment causes oxidative stress in cells which is accompanied by upregulation of the APP and A\u03b2 in a concentration-dependent manner. NP exposure also leads to more secretion of sAPP\u03b2 rather than sAPP\u03b1, leading to increased activation of \u03b2-secretase in NP-received cells. All the harmful effects accumulate in neurons that cannot be renovated, leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This study approved iron-based NPs could help to develop Alzheimer's and related neurological disorders and explained why some of the iron chelators have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. Fe2O3-NP induced oxidative stress in hippocampal cells in a concentration dependent manner.Fe2O3-NP imposed up-regulation of APP in hippocampal cells.Fe2O3-NP activated \u03b2-secretase and elevated sAPP\u03b2/sAPP\u03b1 ratio.Cumulative effects of Fe2O3-NP damages increased cell death in neurons. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by chronic neurodegeneration, impairment of memory, and disturbed planning, language, and thinking ability. In recent years, the use of nanoparticles has been increased in all aspects of life. Among these nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3-NP) are vital in biological sciences, medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and optical imaging. Considering the general application and high reactivity of iron, growing concerns exist about the Fe2O3-NP application harms, especially in the central nervous system. Hippocampus tissue is one of the affected tissues in AD, which is widely investigated in recent years. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of Fe2O3-NP on the primary culture of the hippocampus as one of the main tissues damaged in patients with AD. Our results revealed that treatment with different concentrations of Fe2O3-NP caused cellular damage in hippocampal cells. Exposure to Fe2O3-NP also caused oxidative stress. Our results showed a close association between oxidative stress and AD's pathological symptoms. The Fe2O3-NP application in medicine and biology should be limited.",

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias typically begins long before clinical impairment. Identifying people experiencing subclinical decline may facilitate earlier intervention. This study developed cognitive trajectory clusters using longitudinally based random slope and change point parameter estimates from a Preclinical Alzheimer's disease Cognitive Composite and examined how baseline and most recently available clinical/health-related characteristics, cognitive statuses and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease varied across these cognitive clusters. Data were drawn from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, a longitudinal cohort study of adults from late midlife, enriched for a parental history of Alzheimer's disease and without dementia at baseline. Participants who were cognitively unimpaired at the baseline visit with \u22653 cognitive visits were included in trajectory modelling (n = 1068). The following biomarker data were available for subsets: positron emission tomography amyloid (amyloid: n = 367; [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB): global PiB distribution volume ratio); positron emission tomography tau (tau: n = 321; [18F]MK-6240: primary regions of interest meta-temporal composite); MRI neurodegeneration (neurodegeneration: n = 581; hippocampal volume and global brain atrophy); T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI white matter ischaemic lesion volumes (vascular: white matter hyperintensities; n = 419); and plasma pTau217 (n = 165). Posterior median estimate person-level change points, slopes' pre- and post-change point and estimated outcome (intercepts) at change point for cognitive composite were extracted from Bayesian Bent-Line Regression modelling and used to characterize cognitive trajectory groups (K-means clustering). A common method was used to identify amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/vascular biomarker thresholds. We compared demographics, last visit cognitive status, health-related factors and amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/vascular biomarkers across the cognitive groups using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, \u03c72, and Fisher's exact tests. Mean (standard deviation) baseline and last cognitive assessment ages were 58.4 (6.4) and 66.6 (6.6) years, respectively. Cluster analysis identified three cognitive trajectory groups representing steep, n = 77 (7.2%); intermediate, n = 446 (41.8%); and minimal, n = 545 (51.0%) cognitive decline. The steep decline group was older, had more females, APOE e4 carriers and mild cognitive impairment/dementia at last visit; it also showed worse self-reported general health-related and vascular risk factors and higher amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensity positive proportions at last visit. Subtle cognitive decline was consistently evident in the steep decline group and was associated with generally worse health. In addition, cognitive trajectory groups differed on aetiology-informative biomarkers and risk factors, suggesting an intimate link between preclinical cognitive patterns and amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/vascular biomarker differences in late middle-aged adults. The result explains some of the heterogeneity in cognitive performance within cognitively unimpaired late middle-aged adults.",

The gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) inhibits amyloid plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus, improves cognitive dysfunction by increasing acetylcholine levels, and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the effect of the GEF on the cognitive performance of subjects with subjective memory impairment (SMI). In this eight-week, randomized, assessor- and participant-blinded, placebo-controlled study, participants with SMI were assigned to three groups receiving placebo, GEF 300 mg/day or GEF 600 mg/day. The Korean versions of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (K-ADAS), Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and Stroop color-word test (K-SCWT) were also evaluated along with the safety profiles. One hundred thirty-six participants completed the study. After eight weeks, we analyzed intergroup differences in primary or secondary outcome score changes. When we compared the GEF group with the placebo group, we observed significant improvements in the K-ADAS and K-SCWT scores. The GEF group did not show a significant improvement in K-MMSE and BDI scores compared to the placebo group. No adverse events were observed in the gintonin and placebo groups for eight weeks. The GEF is safe and effective in improving subjective cognitive impairment related to both the K-ADAS and K-SCWT in this study. However, further large-scale and randomized controlled studies are warranted to secure other cognitive function tests besides the K-ADAS and K-SCWT, and to confirm the findings of the current study.",

While existing medications often have adverse effects, traditional use of Tiliacora triandra in Thailand shows its potential as a revitalizing neurotonic agent. This study explores the impact of T. triandra leaf extract on cognitive behaviors, neuronal density, and oxidative stress in male rats with scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. Experimental groups composed of a control, vehicle, positive control meditation, and T. triandra extract-treated groups (100, 200, and 400\u00a0mg/kg BW) over 14 days, with scopolamine administration (i.p.) between days 8 and 14. Results showed significant enhancements in the discrimination ratio and spontaneous alteration behavior percentage during novel object recognition (NORT) and Y-maze tests for scopolamine-administered rats treated with T. triandra extract or donepezil. In contrast, open field test (OFT)-assessed spontaneous locomotor activity displayed no significant difference. Notably, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduced significantly in scopolamine-treated rats with T. triandra extract or the positive control. Moreover, neuronal density in the hippocampal CA3 region, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities increased significantly. However, catalase (CAT) activity exhibited no significant difference. In conclusion, T. triandra leaf extract shows promise in mitigating scopolamine-induced memory deficits, potentially attributed to increased neuronal density, inhibited AChE activity, reduced MDA levels, and enhanced antioxidant activities. This extract has potential as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease-associated memory impairment.",

The procedures were hydro-distillation, hydro-steam distillation, microwave-assisted hydro-distillation, and open hydro-distillation. The hydro-distillation had five pH levels (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and four NaCl concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2%). microwave-assisted hydro-distillation at a power of 225 W was applied for 60, 90, and 120 minutes for process durations. The solvent extraction of herbal distillate obtained by an open hydro-distillation system was done using n-pentane and n-hexane to achieve a recovered essential oil by a rotary evaporator. The results showed that the lowest pH in the hydro-distillation process led to obtaining double yield compared to the control. Additionally, at 1 and 1.5% NaCl concentrations, the oil yield increased by 12.86 and 20.87%, respectively. Although the yield was reduced by microwave-assisted hydro-distillation, however within 120 minutes, carvone increased by 12.7% and limonene decreased by 42.3%.

One of the most damaging air pollutants is PM2.5 pollution, fine airborne particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter. Exposure to PM2.5 pollution can cause premature death, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, diabetes, asthma, low birthweight, and IQ loss. To avoid these adverse health effects, the WHO recommends that PM2.5 levels not exceed 5\u2009\u03bcg/m3. This study estimates the negative health impacts of PM2.5 pollution in Texas in 2016. Local exposure estimates were calculated at the census tract level using the EPA's BenMAP-CE software. In BenMAP, a variety of exposure-response functions combine air pollution exposure data with population data and county-level disease and death data to estimate the number of health effects attributable to PM2.5 pollution for each census tract. The health effects investigated were mortality, low birthweight, stroke, new onset asthma, new onset Alzheimer's, and non-fatal lung cancer. This study found that approximately 26.7 million (98.9%) of the 27.0 million people living in Texas in 2016 resided in areas where PM2.5 concentrations were above the WHO recommendation of 5\u2009\u03bcg/m3, and that 2.6 million people (9.8%) lived in areas where the average PM2.5 concentration exceeded 10\u2009\u03bcg/m3. This study estimates that there were 8,405 (confidence interval [CI], 5,674-11,033) premature deaths due to PM2.5 pollution in Texas in 2016, comprising 4.3% of all deaths. Statewide increases in air-pollution-related morbidity and mortality were seen for stroke (2,209 - CI: [576, 3,776]), low birthweight (2,841 - CI: [1,696, 3,925]), non-fatal lung cancers (636 - CI: [219, 980]), new onset Alzheimer's disease (24,575 - CI: [20,800, 27,540]), and new onset asthma (7,823 - CI: [7,557, 8,079]). This study found that air pollution poses significant risks to the health of Texans, despite the fact that pollution levels across most of the state comply with the EPA standard for PM2.5 pollution of 12\u2009\u03bcg/m3. Improving air quality in Texas could save thousands of lives from disease, disability, and premature death.",

The log-transformed TBRs in the central lobe (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.161, p\u2009=\u20090.0026), frontal lobe (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.145, p\u2009=\u20090.0044), parietal lobe (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.166, p\u2009=\u20090.0028), occipital lobe (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.158, p\u2009=\u20090.0058), and temporal lobe (beta\u2009=\u20090.162, p\u2009=\u20090.0042) were significantly and positively associated with increases in MDS-OA\u03b2 levels. After adjusting for the Bonferroni correction, the TBRs in all lobe regions, except the occipital lobe, were significantly associated with increased MDS-OA\u03b2 levels. We found a significant association of MDS-OA\u03b2 with TBR in older adults. This finding indicates that an increase in amyloid burden may be associated with an increase in the low-frequency band and a decrease in the relatively high-frequency band.",

        "AbstractText": "Florbetapir positron emission tomography (AV45 PET) is a widely employed modality for detecting cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition. However, in clinical settings, patients with cognitive impairment are frequently unable to sustain adequate stillness during the scanning procedure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of a short acquisition time on the image quality and A\u03b2 detectability of AV45 PET. In this cross-sectional study, 29 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 13 healthy participants underwent 15-minute AV45 PET/magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The PET data were subsequently reconstructed into 15-, 10-, 8-, 6-, 4-, 2-, and 1-minute duration groups (G15, G10, G8, G6, G4, G2, and G1). Subjective PET image quality was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale (poor-excellent: 1-5), and objective image quality was evaluated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 1 cm3 region of interest (ROI) inside the cerebellum. A\u03b2 detectability was assessed by the calculation of regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values in all groups. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and paired t-test were performed to compare the subjective scores, SNR, and SUVR values. The visual inspection was also performed by 2 nuclear physicians to give a binary diagnosis to each case. The subjective scores were decreased in the groups with shortened scanning time relative to the G15 group (4.67\u00b10.48, all P<0.05). Notably, a good image quality score was also given to the G10 group (4.40\u00b10.63), and sufficient image quality could be achieved with the G8 (3.86\u00b10.68) and G6 (3.14\u00b10.52) groups. The SNR values were decreased by 10.33%, 17.74%, and 23.26% in the G10, G8, and G6 group, respectively (all P<0.05). Compared with the G15 group (1.48\u00b10.16), the composite SUVR values were increased in the G10 (1.50\u00b10.16), G8 (1.50\u00b10.17), and G6 groups (1.51\u00b10.18, all P<0.05). By visual inspection, the diagnoses of each case in the G10, G8, and G6 group were identical with those in the G15 group. The acquisition time of AV45 PET is required to reach at least 6 minutes to achieve acceptable image quality and maintained A\u03b2 detectability.",

Cognitive decline is thought to manifest in intrinsic brain activity changes, but research results yielded conflicting and few studies have explored the roles of brain regions in cognitive decline, and sensitivity of the cognitive field to changes in the altered intrinsic brain activity. In this cross-sectional study, 158 elderly participants were recruited from the memory clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from July 2019 to May 2021, and grouped into SCD (n=73), MCI (n=46), and normal controls (NC) (n=39). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated and evaluated among the groups. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was conducted to investigate the associations between imaging outcomes and cognitive behaviors. Neuropsychological tests in different cognitive dimensions and ALFF values of the prefrontal, parietal, and temporal gyrus, were significantly different (P<0.05) among the three groups, with no appreciable decline in daily activity. The changes in intrinsic activities were closely related to the decline in cognitive function (R=0.73, P=0.002). ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus played significant roles in the analysis, while the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Auditory-Verbal Learning Test scores were found to be more sensitive to changes in ALFF values. Spontaneous brain activity is a stable imaging biomarker of cognitive impairment. ALFF changes of the prefrontal, occipital, left angular, and temporal gyrus were sensitive to identifying cognitive decline, and the scores of the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test and MoCA could predict the abnormal intrinsic activities.",

However, the extent of the dynamism and plasticity of these microglial states, as well as their functional significance, remains elusive, partly due to the lack of specific tools. Here, we report the generation of an inducible Cre driver line, Clec7a-CreERT2, designed to target PAM and DAM in the brain parenchyma. Utilizing this tool, we profile labeled cells during development and in several disease models, uncovering convergence and context-dependent differences in PAM/DAM gene expression. Through long-term tracking, we demonstrate surprising levels of plasticity in these microglial states.

        "AbstractText": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, plaque and tangle accumulation trigger an inflammatory response that mounts positive feed-back loops between inflammation and protein aggregation, aggravating neurite damage and neuronal death. One of the earliest brain regions to undergo neurodegeneration is the locus coeruleus (LC), the predominant site of norepinephrine (NE) production in the central nervous system (CNS). In animal models of AD, dampening the impact of noradrenergic signaling pathways, either through administration of beta blockers or pharmacological ablation of the LC, heightened neuroinflammation through increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Since microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, it is reasonable to postulate that they are responsible for translating the loss of NE tone into exacerbated disease pathology. Recent findings from our lab demonstrated that noradrenergic signaling inhibits microglia dynamics via \u03b22 adrenergic receptors (\u03b22ARs), suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory role for microglial \u03b22AR signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that microglial \u03b22 adrenergic signaling is progressively impaired during AD progression, which leads to the chronic immune vigilant state of microglia that worsens disease pathology. First, we characterized changes in microglial \u03b22AR signaling as a function of amyloid pathology. We found that LC neurons and their projections degenerate early and progressively in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD; accompanied by mild decrease in the levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite normetanephrine. Interestingly, while 5xFAD microglia, especially plaque-associated microglia, significant downregulated \u03b22AR gene expression early in amyloid pathology, they did not lose their responsiveness to \u03b22AR stimulation. Most importantly, we demonstrated that specific microglial \u03b22AR deletion worsened disease pathology while chronic \u03b22AR stimulation resulted in attenuation of amyloid pathology and associated neuritic damage, suggesting microglial \u03b22AR might be used as potential therapeutic target to modify AD pathology.",

Most donors (81.9%) showed earliest pathology in the olfactory bulb, followed by accumulation in either limbic (60.8%) or brainstem (21.1%) regions. The remaining donors (18.1%) exhibited the first abnormalities in brainstem regions. Early limbic pathology was associated with Alzheimer's disease-associated characteristics. Meanwhile, brainstem-first pathology was associated with progressive motor impairment and substantial LB pathology outside of the brain. Our data provides evidence for heterogeneity in the temporal spread of LB pathology, possibly explaining some of the clinical disparities observed in LBDs.",

PLCG2 polymorphisms are associated with both reduced and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and with longevity. In the brain, PLCG2 is highly expressed in microglia, where it is proposed to regulate phagocytosis, secretion of cytokines/chemokines, cell survival and proliferation. We analyzed the brains of three-month-old PLC\u03b32 knockout (KO), heterozygous (HET), and wild-type (WT) mice using multiomics approaches, including shotgun lipidomics, proteomics, and gene expression profiling, and immunofluorescence. Lipidomic analyses revealed sex-specific losses of total cerebrum PIP2 and decreasing trends of DAG content in KOs. In addition, PLC\u03b32 depletion led to significant losses of myelin-specific lipids and decreasing trends of myelin-enriched lipids. Consistent with our lipidomics results, RNA profiling revealed sex-specific changes in the expression levels of several myelin-related genes. Further, consistent with the available literature, gene expression profiling revealed subtle changes on microglia phenotype in mature adult KOs under baseline conditions, suggestive of reduced microglia reactivity. Immunohistochemistry confirmed subtle differences in density of microglia and oligodendrocytes in KOs. Exploratory proteomic pathway analyses revealed changes in KO and HET females compared to WTs, with over-abundant proteins pointing to mTOR signaling, and under-abundant proteins to oligodendrocytes. Overall, our data indicate that loss of PLC\u03b32 has subtle effects on brain homeostasis that may underlie enhanced vulnerability to AD pathology and aging via novel mechanisms in addition to regulation of microglia function.",

Shingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%. Our results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.",

However, low-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively impact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for recovering underlying signal from noisy counterparts. However, neural networks trained on a specific noise level cannot be easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude and variances. To obtain optimal denoised results, we may need to train multiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may be infeasible in reality due to limited data availability. Denoising dynamic PET images presents additional challenge due to tracer decay and continuously changing noise levels across dynamic frames. To address these issues, we propose a Unified Noise-aware Network (UNN) that combines multiple sub-networks with varying denoising power to generate optimal denoised results regardless of the input noise levels. Evaluated using large-scale data from two medical centers with different vendors, presented results showed that the UNN can consistently produce promising denoised results regardless of input noise levels, and demonstrate superior performance over networks trained on single noise level data, especially for extremely low-count data.",

We have devised a simple technique of marking the point of anastomosis with a needle prick at two points taking the diameter of pedicle vein to aid in identification of point of anastomosis. This method is very reliable to ascertain the suitable lie of the pedicle vein. The diameter of the lumen for anastomosis is maintained. We had a success rate of 100% with all the cases we applied this technique on.",

        "AbstractText": "Oral Submucous fibrosis has a substantial burden on the Indian population; thus there is a substantial need for a validated questionnaire assessing QoL in Hindi. Thus, a prospective cross-sectional study was designed to translate and validate the English version of the OHR QoL-OSF questionnaire into Hindi. We followed the guidelines suggested by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) for the translation procedure and subsequently validated the translated questionnaire with reliability and validity. A total of 50 patients were included in this pilot study. Cronbach's alpha for 17 items was 0.87 signifying high reliability. All questions had an I-CVI of 1.00, demonstrating complete agreement among the content experts regarding the relevance and clarity of items in the questionnaire. Convergent validity was adequately established for all factors except for factor 3 for which it was around 0.43. The intraclass coefficient was 0.803 showing good agreement between the test-retest results. The Hindi version of the OHR QoL questionnaire is a reliable instrument having good reliability, good content, good acceptability, and good responsiveness, and thus appears to be a valid instrument. Large studies with large sample sizes can be conducted in the future. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12663-023-01927-2.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Serum Concentration of MMP-9 as a Predictive Biomarker for the Progression of Oral Cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Oral cancer is the most prominent cancer subtype among all head and neck cancers, the incidence and prevalence of which has been consistently increasing in past years around the globe. At advanced stages, oral cancer imparts significant mortality, morbidity, and mutilation among the patients, and therefore, diagnosis and treatment of the disease at early stages are considered the optimum strategy for the management of the disease. Since molecular changes appear earlier than physical symptoms, several molecular biomarkers are currently being investigated for their role in diagnosing and treating disease. MMP-9 belongs to the family of proteinases that are involved in cytoskeletal degradation, which is a crucial phase of cancer progression. In the present study, we analyzed the serum concentration of MMP-9 in oral cancer patients and tried to establish MMP-9 as a predictive biomarker for the progression of oral cancer.\u00a0We also correlated the clinical, sociodemographic and\u00a0biochemical parameters with the serum concentration of MMP-9 in oral cancer patients. Serum was extracted from the blood sample of 38 oral cancer patients and was analyzed for the concentration of MMP-9 using sandwiched ELISA.\u00a0Predesigned proforma was used to capture the clinical, sociodemographic and biochemical parameters. Unpaired t-test was used to compare two means, one way ANOVA was used to compare more than two means and Pearson's correlation was used to correlate the variables. The mean concentration of MMP-9 in patients of oral cancer was 816.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009236.1\u00a0ng/mL. The MMP-9 expression level was higher at advanced oral cancer stages than in the early stages. No significant difference in the\u00a0MMP expression was found in terms of\u00a0sociodemographic risk factor\u00a0and tumor site. MMP-9 exhibit significant negative\u00a0correlation with the HDL\u00a0and significantly positive correlation with the PTI. Rest of the\u00a0biochemical parameters\u00a0does not exhibit significant correlation. The present study suggests that serum concentration of MMP-9 can be a predictive biomarker for the progression of oral cancer, which needs to be validated by performing further longitudinal cross-sectional studies by taking ample sample size.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Shame and Stigma Over Long-Term Survival in Postoperative Cases of Head and Neck Cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Surgical excision of the tumor remains the primary choice for the treatment of head and neck cancer patients, but it often leads to facial disfigurement, which further causes mutilation in the patients. Mutilation causes shame and stigma, which imparts significant psychological strain on patients, and tends to impair their quality of life. The present study aimed to assess the shame and stigma over long-term postoperative survival duration in head and neck cancer patients. Total 100 postoperative patients of head and neck cancer were recruited from the outpatient department of the host institute, and shame and stigma was assessed using the Hindi version of the shame and stigma scale. The global shame and stigma score was 22.67\u2009\u00b1\u200916.22, with the highest perceived stigma due to changes in appearance (11.94\u2009\u00b1\u20098.805), followed by impaired speech (4.490\u2009\u00b1\u20093.243), feeling of regret (3.950\u2009\u00b1\u20093.313), and feeling of\u00a0stigma (4.490\u2009\u00b1\u20093.243). The shame and stigma was found to be significantly higher in maxillary cancer patients (33.22\u2009\u00b1\u200916.60), followed by larynx cancer patients\u00a0(22.06\u2009\u00b1\u200913.41) and oral cancer patients\u00a0(21.53\u2009\u00b1\u200916.49). Patients with stage III and stage IV of cancer were found to perceive higher shame and stigma (35.91\u2009\u00b1\u200922.23 and 27.36\u2009\u00b1\u200914.71, respectively) compared to the patients having stage I and stage II cancer (9.583\u2009\u00b1\u20099.709 and 16.44\u2009\u00b1\u200911.82, respectively). A significantly declining linear trend was found between shame and stigma and postoperative survival duration. We concluded that shame and stigma act as important determinants of quality of life over long-term survival in head and neck cancer patients,\u00a0and should be considered while designing psychological interventions and surgical reconstruction protocols. The present study will help clinicians to assess the mutilation among head and neck cancer patients in a better way and will help in devising new psychological strategies to manage psychological aspects associated with mutilation, which will ultimately enhance the quality of life of patients.",

To address large unanswered questions regarding exosome biology in vivo, we created the Exomap1 transgenic mouse, which in response to Cre recombinase expresses the most highly enriched exosomal marker protein known, human CD81, fused to mNeonGreen (HsCD81mNG), and prior to Cre expresses a mitochondrial red fluorescent protein. Validation of the exomap1 mouse with eight distinct Cre drivers demonstrated that HsCD81mNG was expressed only in response to Cre, that murine cells correctly localized HsCD81mNG to the plasma membrane, and that this led to the secretion of HsCD81mNG in EVs that had the size (~70-80 nm), topology, and composition of exosomes. Furthermore, cell type-specific activation of the exomap1 transgene allowed us to use quantitative single molecule localization microscopy to calculate the cell type-specific contribution to biofluid exosome populations. Specifically, we show that neurons contribute ~1% to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid exosome populations whereas hepatocytes contribute ~15% to plasma exosome populations, numbers that reflect the known vascular permeabilities of brain and liver. These observations validate the use of Exomap1 mouse models for in vivo studies of exosome biology.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women with cervical pathology treated surgically over seven years. All patients with surgical interventions of the cervix were recorded and analyzed according to the recurrence following their primary treatment. We utilized the Chi-square test and the multivariate regression analysis to identify recurrence risk factors. We also employed the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for disease recurrence. In total, 83 patients were reported; 81 (97.6 %) were treated with loop electrosurgical excision, and two (2.4 %) with cold knife conization. The histopathological results of the treatment approach showed one case (1.2 %) of low-grade intraepithelial lesions, 70 (84.4 %) high-grade intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), five (6 %) with IA1, and two (2.4 %) with IA2, cervical cancer, while in five patients (6 %) the results were negative for cervical pathology. Recurrence was diagnosed in 23 cases (27.7 %), and HSIL was diagnosed in 10 patients (12 %). The median time of recurrence was 11.6 months.

This retrospective study included 3 cases of 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis with germ cell tumors evaluated and managed at the Department of Endocrinology, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Kashmir, over a period of 13 years from (September 2008 to December 2021). Over a period of 13 years, we diagnosed and managed 7 patients with 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis. This included 4 patients with pure gonadal dysgenesis (PGD; Swyer syndrome), 2 patients with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD), and one patient with partial gonadal dysgenesis. Out of these 7 patients, three patients developed germ cell tumors, one patient with MGD, and two patients with pure PGD (Swyer syndrome). In all three patients, germ cell tumor was the first presentation of DSD. The patient with MGD presented with primary amenorrhea and virilization, while the two patients with PGD presented as phenotypic females with primary amenorrhea and pelvic mass. All three patients developed seminomatous cancers. Patient with MGD developed seminoma and the two patients with PGD (Swyer syndrome) developed dysgerminoma. The patients were managed with bilateral gonadectomy with removal of the tumor. In addition, the 2 patients with PGD (Swyer syndrome) received combined chemotherapy. On a follow up ranging from 1 to 10 years, all three patients are disease free. we conclude that germ cell tumors may be the first presentation of 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis. In all phenotypic females with primary amenorrhea and dysgerminoma, karyotype is a must to uncover the diagnosis of PGD. In addition virilization may be clue to the presence of germ cell tumor in a patient with 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Colon cancer is a malignant tumor with high malignancy and a low survival rate whose heterogeneity limits systemic immunotherapy. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway-related genes are associated with multiple tumors, but their role in prognosis prediction and tumor microenvironment (TME) regulation in colon cancer is poorly understood. Using bioinformatics, this study aimed to construct a risk prediction signature for colon cancer, which may provide a means for developing new effective treatment strategies. Using consensus clustering, patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with colon adenocarcinoma were classified into several subtypes based on the expression of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-related genes, and differences in survival, molecular, and immunological TME characteristics and drug sensitivity were examined in each subtype. Ten genes that make up a TGF-\u03b2-related predictive signature were found by least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) regression using colon cancer data from the TCGA database and confirmed using a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. A nomogram incorporating risk scores and clinicopathologic factors was developed to stratify the prognosis of patients with colon cancer for accurate clinical diagnosis and therapy. Two TGF-\u03b2 subtypes were identified, with the TGF-\u03b2-high subtype being associated with a poorer prognosis and superior sensitivity to immunotherapy. Mutation analyses showed a high incidence of gene mutations in the TGF-\u03b2-high subtype. After completing signature construction, patients with colon cancer were categorized into high- and low-risk subgroups based on the median risk score of the TGF-\u03b2-related predictive signature. The risk score exhibited superior predictive performance relative to age, gender, and stage, as evidenced by its AUC of 0.686. Patients in the high-risk subgroup had higher levels of immunosuppressive cell infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TME, suggesting that these patients had better responses to immunotherapy. Patients with colon cancer were divided into two subtypes with different survival and immune characteristics using consensus clustering analysis based on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-related genes. The constructed risk prediction signature may show promise as a biomarker for evaluating the prognosis of colon cancer, with potential utility for screening individuals for immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "No data exist on the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus camrelizumab doublet as second-line therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although anlotinib and the programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor camrelizumab are used as treatments for ESCC, the combined use of anlotinib and camrelizumab as a second-line therapy has not been reported. Therefore, this study explored the efficacy and toxicity of anlotinib plus camrelizumab as second-line therapy for advanced ESCC. Fifty-eight patients with advanced ESCC undergoing second-line therapy, either with anlotinib plus camrelizumab or anlotinib plus S-1, were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed at Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine from January 2020 to December 2021. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and assessment of toxicity. In patients with advanced ESCC, the anlotinib plus camrelizumab group (N = 32) exhibited longer PFS (8.00 vs. 4.53 months, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), higher ORR (28.1 vs. 19.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.431), and higher DCR (87.5 vs. 65.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) than those in the anlotinib plus S-1 group (N = 26). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were predominantly grade 1/2 in both groups, with a higher incidence of grade 1/2 skin toxicity in patients treated with anlotinib plus camrelizumab (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Two patients (6.3%) developed grade 1/2 immune-related pneumonia. The incidence of grade 3/4 TRAEs did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified that the drug regimen (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and differentiation grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) were independent prognostic factors for PFS.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) contributes greatly to global cancer incidence and is the main cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. It is a complex disease characterized by numerous subtypes with distinct clinical manifestations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are not effective in all patients and have been associated with tumor resistance and immunosuppression. Because amino acid (AA)-catabolizing enzymes have been shown to regulate immunosuppressive effects, this review investigated the immunosuppressive roles of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme, which is overexpressed in various metastatic tumors. It promotes immunomodulatory effects by depleting Trp in the regional microenvironment. This leads to a reduction in the number of immunogenic immune cells, such as effector T and natural killer (NK) cells, and an increase in tolerogenic immune cells, such as regulatory T (Treg) cells. The BC tumor microenvironment (TME) establishes a supportive niche where cancer cells can interact with immune cells and neighboring endothelial cells and is thus a feasible target for cancer therapy. In many immunological contexts, IDO1 regulates immune control by causing regional metabolic changes in the TME and tissue environment, which may further affect the maturation of systemic immunological tolerance. In the development of effective treatment targets and approaches, it is essential to understand the immunomodulatory effects exerted by AA-catabolizing enzymes, such as IDO1, on the components of the TME.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Supplemental Screening as an Adjunct to Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening in People With Dense Breasts: A Health Technology Assessment.",
        "AbstractText": "Screening with mammography aims to detect breast cancer before clinical symptoms appear. Among people with dense breasts, some cancers may be missed using mammography alone. The addition of supplemental imaging as an adjunct to screening mammography has been suggested to detect breast cancers missed on mammography, potentially reducing the number of deaths associated with the disease. We conducted a health technology assessment of supplemental screening with contrast-enhanced mammography, ultrasound, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an adjunct to mammography for people with dense breasts, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, harms, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening, the preferences and values of patients and health care providers, and ethical issues. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence published from January 2015 to October 2021. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias or RoBANS tools, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted cost-effectiveness analyses with a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography for people with dense breasts in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of supplemental screening for dense breasts, we spoke with people with dense breasts who had undergone supplemental screening; performed a rapid review of the qualitative literature; and conducted an ethical analysis of supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography. We included eight primary studies in the clinical evidence review. No studies evaluated contrast-enhanced mammography. Nonrandomized and randomized evidence (GRADE: Very low to Moderate) suggests that mammography plus ultrasound was more sensitive and less specific, and detected more cancers compared to mammography alone. Fewer interval cancers occurred after mammography plus ultrasound (GRADE: Very low to Low), but recall rates were nearly double that of mammography alone (GRADE: Very low to Moderate). Evidence of Low to Very low quality suggested that compared with supplemental DBT, supplemental ultrasound was more sensitive, detected more cancers, and led to more recalls. Among people with extremely dense breasts, fewer interval cancers occurred after mammography plus supplemental MRI compared to mammography alone (GRADE: High). Supplemental MRI after negative mammography was highly accurate in people with extremely dense breasts and heterogeneously dense breasts in nonrandomized and randomized studies (GRADE: Very Low and Moderate). In people with extremely dense breasts, MRI after negative mammography detected 16.5 cancers per 1,000 screens (GRADE: Moderate), and up to 9.5% of all people screened were recalled (GRADE: Moderate). Contrast-related adverse events were infrequent (GRADE: Moderate). No study reported psychological impacts, breast cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality.We included nine studies in the economic evidence, but none of the study findings was directly applicable to the Ontario context. Our lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses showed that supplemental screening with ultrasound, MRI, or DBT found more screen-detected cancers, decreased the number of interval cancers, had small gains in life-years or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and was associated with savings in cancer management costs. However, supplemental screening also increased imaging costs and the number of false-positive cases. Compared to mammography alone, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound, MRI, or DBT for people with dense breasts were $119,943, $314,170, and $212,707 per QALY gained, respectively. The ICERs for people with extremely dense breasts were $83,529, $101,813, and $142,730 per QALY gained, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, the diagnostic test sensitivity of mammography alone and of mammography plus supplemental screening had the greatest effect on ICER estimates. The total budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound, MRI, or DBT for people with dense breasts over the next 5 years is estimated at $15 million, $41 million, or $33 million, respectively. The corresponding total budget impact for people with extremely dense breasts is $4 million, $10 million, or $9 million.We engaged directly with 70 people via interviews and an online survey. The participants provided diverse perspectives on broad access to supplemental screening for people with dense breasts in Ontario. Themes discussed in the interviews included self-advocacy, patient-doctor partnership, preventive care, and a shared preference for broad access to screening modalities that are clinically effective in detecting breast cancer in people with dense breasts.We included 10 studies in the qualitative evidence rapid review. Thematic synthesis of these reports yielded three analytical themes: coming to know and understand breast density, which included introductions to and making sense of breast density; experiences of vulnerability, which influenced or were influenced by understandings and misunderstandings of breast density and responses to breast density; and choosing supplemental screening, which was influenced by knowledge and perception of the risks and benefits of supplemental screening, and the availability of resources.The ethics review determined that the main harms of supplemental screening for people with dense breasts are false-positives and overdiagnosis, both of which lead to unnecessary and burdensome health care treatments. Screening programs raise inherent tensions between individual- and population-level interests; they may yield population-level benefit, but are statistically of very little benefit to individuals. Entrenched cultural beliefs about the value of breast cancer screening, combined with uncertainty about the effects of supplemental screening on some outcomes and the discomfort of many health care providers in discussing screening options for people with dense breasts suggest that it may be difficult to ensure that patients can provide informed consent to engage in supplemental screening. Funding supplemental screening for people with dense breasts may lead to improved equity in the effectiveness of identifying cancers in people with dense breasts (compared to mammography alone), but it is not clear whether it would lead to equity in terms of improved survival and decreased morbidity. Supplemental screening with ultrasound, DBT, or MRI as an adjunct to mammography detected more cancers and increased the number of recalls and biopsies, including false-positive results. Fewer interval cancers tended to occur after supplemental screening compared to mammography alone. It is unclear whether supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography would reduce breast cancer-related or overall mortality among people with dense breasts.Supplemental screening with ultrasound, DBT, or MRI as an adjunct to mammography in people aged 50 to 74 years improved cancer detection but increased costs. Depending on the type of imaging modality, publicly funding supplemental screening in Ontario over the next 5 years would require additional total costs between $15 million and $41 million for people with dense breasts, and between $4 million and $10 million for people with extremely dense breasts.The people we engaged with directly valued the potential clinical benefits of supplemental screening and emphasized that patient education and equitable access should be a requirement for implementation in Ontario. Our review of the qualitative literature found that the concept of breast density is poorly understood, both by people with dense breasts and by some general practitioners. People with dense breasts who receive routine mammography (especially those who receive health care in their nonpreferred language or are perceived to have lower economic status or health literacy) and their general practitioners may not have the awareness or knowledge to make informed decisions about supplemental screening. Some people with dense breasts experienced emotional distress from barriers to accessing supplemental screening, and many wanted to engage in supplemental screening, even when educated about its potential harms, including false-positives and overdiagnosis.Given an overall lack of robust evidence about morbidity and mortality associated with supplemental screening for people with dense breasts, it is not possible to determine whether funding supplemental screening for dense breasts delivers on the ethical duties to maximize benefits and minimize harms for populations and individuals. It is likely that existing inequities in access to breast screening and cancer treatment will persist, even if supplemental screening for dense breasts is funded. Continued efforts to address these inequities by removing barriers to screening might mitigate this concern. It will be important to identify and minimize sources of uncertainty related to benefits and risks of supplemental screening for dense breasts to optimize the capacity for everyone involved to live up to their ethical obligations. Some of these may be resolved with further evidence related to the outcomes of supplemental screening for dense breasts.",

All PET tracers mentioned in this mini review were able to delineate disease from normal tissues, but some \u03b1v\u03b26 PET tracers are better than others for particular clinical applications. Each \u03b1v\u03b26 PET tracer was validated for its ability to bind integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 with high affinity. However, all the head-to-tail cyclized peptide PET-tracers reviewed here did not accumulate in the GI-tract, in striking contrast to the linear and disulfide-bonded counterparts currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer, IPF and long COVID. Multiple independent investigators have reported the presence of \u03b26 mRNA as well as \u03b1v\u03b26 protein in the GI-tract.

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health problem. Theragnostic is a term that refers to the integration of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into a single system for personalized medicine. Theragnostic care in HCC involves the use of imaging techniques to diagnose the cancer and assess its characteristics, such as size, location, and extent of spread. Theragnostics involves the use of molecular and genetic tests to identify specific biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions and, post-treatment, assess the dosimetry and localization of the treatment, thus guiding future treatment. This can be done through either positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using radiolabeled tracers that target specific molecules expressed by HCC cells or radioembolization. This technique can help identify the location and extent of the cancer, as well as provide information on the tumor's metabolic activity and blood supply. In summary, theragnostics is an emerging field that holds promise for improving the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. By combining diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into a single system, theragnostics can help guide personalized treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Ionizing radiation and microgravity are two considerable health risks encountered during deep space exploration. Both have deleterious effects on the human body. On one hand, weightlessness is known to induce a weakening of the immune system, delayed wound healing and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor deconditioning. On the other hand, radiation exposure can lead to long-term health effects such as cancer and cataracts as well as have an adverse effect on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Ionizing radiation originates from three main sources in space: galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle events and solar winds. Furthermore, inside the spacecraft and inside certain space habitats on Lunar and Martian surfaces, the crew is exposed to intravehicular radiation, which arises from nuclear reactions between space radiation and matter. Besides the approaches already in use, such as radiation shielding materials (such as aluminium, water or polyethylene), alternative shielding materials (including boron nanotubes, complex hybrids, composite hybrid materials, and regolith) and active shielding (using fields to deflect radiation particles) are being investigated for their abilities to mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation. From a biological point of view, it can be predicted that exposure to ionizing radiation during missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will affect the human body in undesirable ways, e.g., increasing the risks of cataracts, cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases, carcinogenesis, as well as accelerated ageing. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the risks related to deep space exploration and to develop mitigation strategies to reduce these risks to a tolerable level. By using biomarkers for radiation sensitivity, space agencies are developing extensive personalised medical examination programmes to determine an astronaut's vulnerability to radiation. Moreover, researchers are developing pharmacological solutions (e.g., radioprotectors and radiomitigators) to proactively or reactively protect astronauts during deep space exploration. Finally, research is necessary to develop more effective countermeasures for use in future human space missions, which can also lead to improvements to medical care on Earth. This review will discuss the risks space travel beyond LEO poses to astronauts, methods to monitor astronauts' health, and possible approaches to mitigate these risks.",

Compared to traditional anatomic imaging techniques, diagnostic radionuclide-based molecular imaging systems exhibit much greater sensitivity and ability to precisely illustrate the biodistribution and metabolic processes from a functional perspective in breast cancer; this transitions diagnosis from an invasive visualization to a noninvasive visualization, potentially ensuring earlier diagnosis and on-time treatment. Radionuclide therapy is a newly developed modality for the treatment of breast cancer in which radionuclides are delivered to tumors and/or tumor-associated targets either directly or using delivery vehicles. Radionuclide therapy has been proven to be eminently effective and to exhibit low toxicity when eliminating both primary tumors and metastases and even undetected tumors. In addition, the specific interaction between the surface modules of the delivery vehicles and the targets on the surface of tumor cells enables radionuclide targeting therapy, and this represents an exceptional potential for this treatment in breast cancer. This article reviews the development of radionuclide molecular imaging techniques that are currently employed for early breast cancer diagnosis and both the progress and challenges of radionuclide therapy employed in breast cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "The treatment with 177Lutetium PSMA (177Lu-PSMA) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has recently been approved by the FDA and EMA. Since treatment success is highly variable between patients, the prediction of treatment response and identification of short- and long-term survivors after treatment could help tailor mCRPC diagnosis and treatment accordingly. The aim of this study is to investigate the value of radiomic parameters extracted from pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA PET images for the prediction of treatment response. A total of 45 mCRPC patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 from two university hospital centers were retrospectively reviewed for this study. Radiomic features were extracted from the volumetric segmentations of metastases in the bone. A random forest model was trained and validated to predict treatment response based on age and conventionally used PET parameters, radiomic features and combinations thereof. Further, overall survival was predicted by using the identified radiomic signature and compared to a Cox regression model based on age and PET parameters. The machine learning model based on a combined radiomic signature of three features and patient age achieved an AUC of 0.82 in 5-fold cross-validation and outperformed models based on age and PET parameters or radiomic features (AUC, 0.75 and 0.76, respectively). A Cox regression model based on this radiomic signature showed the best performance to predict overall survival (C-index, 0.67). Our results demonstrate that a machine learning model to predict response to 177Lu-PSMA treatment based on a combination of radiomics and patient age outperforms a model based on age and PET parameters. Moreover, the identified radiomic signature based on pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA PET images might be able to identify patients with an improved outcome and serve as a supportive tool in clinical decision making.",

While CT scans provide accurate measurements, they depend on manual processes. We developed and validated a deep learning algorithm to automatically select and segment abdominal muscles [SM], visceral fat [VAT], and subcutaneous fat [SAT] on CT scans. A total of 352 CT scans were collected from two cancer centers. The detection of the third lumbar vertebra and three different body tissues (SM, VAT, and SAT) were annotated manually. The 5-fold cross-validation method was used to develop the algorithm and validate its performance on the training cohort. The results were validated on an external, independent group of CT scans. The algorithm for automatic L3 slice selection had a mean absolute error of 4\u2005mm for the internal validation dataset and 5.5\u2005mm for the external validation dataset. The median DICE similarity coefficient for body composition was 0.94 for SM, 0.93 for VAT, and 0.86 for SAT in the internal validation dataset, whereas it was 0.93 for SM, 0.93 for VAT, and 0.85 for SAT in the external validation dataset. There were high correlation scores with sarcopenia metrics in both internal and external validation datasets.

We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset.

Given their rarity in adults, as well as the importance and complexity of their treatment, this paper reviews and discusses the clinical and surgical characteristics of such tumors. In a retrospective single-institution observational study, adult patients with posterior fossa tumors treated surgically over a ten-year period were analyzed. The characteristics observed were age and gender distribution, clinical symptoms, histopathologic tumor type, tumor size, location and extent of surgical resection, tumor recurrence and postoperative complications, as well as surgical outcome. Sixty-six patients who underwent surgical treatment were diagnosed with a tumor in the posterior fossa. The mean age was 63 years, and patients were evenly distributed by gender. The most common histopathologic type was metastatic tumor (59.1%), whereas meningioma was the most common primary brain tumor (16.6%) recorded. Most patients presented with vegetative and cerebellar symptoms in general and cranial nerve palsy, especially in the occurrence of vestibular schwannoma. In conclusion, posterior fossa tumors grow in a confined space and therefore may directly threaten vital centers in their immediate vicinity. Thus, it is crucial to schedule an appropriate surgical intervention as soon as possible, as it can significantly improve treatment outcome and prognosis of the disease. If possible, meticulous total tumor resection should be the treatment of choice.

In the study, eleven subjects were selected from native Tibetan middle-to-long distance runners to participate in an 8-week pre-competition exercise training program consisting of a 6-week training stage in Kangding City at an altitude of 2 560 meters (m) and a subsequent 2-week training stage in Leshan City at an altitude of 360\u00a0\u200bm. Blood samples were collected twice from the runners before beginning altitude exercise training in Kangding and after going to sea level - Leshan City. Using a label-free quantitative method, peptides in the samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins and predict their biological functions. A total of 846 proteins were identified in the 21 samples, including 719 quantified proteins. In total, 49 significantly differentially expressed proteins (p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05) were identified, including twenty-eight 0.2-fold up-regulated proteins or twenty-one 0.17-fold down-regulated proteins. The up-regulated proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and carbonic anhydrase I (CAI), were of particular interest due to their role in regulating the oxygen saturation in deep tissues. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were mainly involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton, local adhesion, biotin absorption and metabolism, immune system, cancer, and membrane transport processes. In conclusion, Tibetan middle-to-long distance runners who resided in high-altitude areas benefited from repeated plateau-plain alternate training mode during the pre-competition period. The training mode induced positive changes in peripheral blood plasma proteins (CFTR and CAI), the biomarkers associated with aerobic capacity.

        "AbstractText": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is second most common form of gynaecological cancer world wide . In this study, we collected and analyzed three ovarian cancer microarray raw datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus, NCBI, and identified a total of 1806 significant DEGs (Differentially expressed genes). The functional analysis of the DEGs showed that the 885 upregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in protein-binding activity, while the downregulated 796 genes were mostly enriched in retinal dehydrogenase activity and GABA receptor binding. We then constructed a protein-protein interaction network of the DEGs DEGs in ovarian cancer datasetsand analyzed the network to find cluster subnets, using molecular complex detection (MCODE). Common genes among top hub gene list, bottleneck gene list and maximum clique centrality (MCC) gene lists were identified as key driver genes, After analyzing the network. The following genes, STK12 (Serine threonine protein kinase), UBE2C (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C), CENPA (Centromere protein A), CCNB1 (Cyclin B1), POLD1 (polymerase delta 1) and KIF11 (Kinesin Family Member 11) were finally identified as driver genes. Higher expression of the key driver genes, STK12, UBE2C, CENPA, CCNB1, POLD1 and KIF11, was associated with lower overall survival (OS) among ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, the identified driver genes could be important diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for predicting ovarian cancer progression and understanding the mechanism of tumour formation and recurrence.",

        "AbstractText": "Low-cost optical imaging technologies have the potential to reduce inequalities in healthcare by improving the detection of pre-cancer or early cancer and enabling more effective and less invasive treatment. In this Review, we summarise technologies for in vivo widefield, multi-spectral, endoscopic, and high-resolution optical imaging that could offer affordable approaches to improve cancer screening and early detection at the point-of-care. Additionally, we discuss approaches to slide-free microscopy, including confocal imaging, lightsheet microscopy, and phase modulation techniques that can reduce the infrastructure and expertise needed for definitive cancer diagnosis. We also evaluate how machine learning-based algorithms can improve the accuracy and accessibility of optical imaging systems and provide real-time image analysis. To achieve the potential of optical technologies, developers must ensure that devices are easy to use; the optical technologies must be evaluated in multi-institutional, prospective clinical tests in the intended setting; and the barriers to commercial scale-up in under-resourced markets must be overcome. Therefore, test developers should view the production of simple and effective diagnostic tools that are accessible and affordable for all countries and settings as a central goal of their profession.",

        "AbstractText": "High dimensional linear models are commonly used in practice. In many applications, one is interested in linear transformations  \u03b2 \u22a4  x of regression coefficients \u03b2 \u2208 R p   , where x is a specific point and is not required to be identically distributed as the training data. One common approach is the plug-in technique which first estimates \u03b2 , then plugs the estimator in the linear transformation for prediction. Despite its popularity, estimation of \u03b2 can be difficult for high dimensional problems. Commonly used assumptions in the literature include that the signal of coefficients \u03b2 is sparse and predictors are weakly correlated. These assumptions, however, may not be easily verified, and can be violated in practice. When \u03b2 is non-sparse or predictors are strongly correlated, estimation of \u03b2 can be very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel pointwise estimator for linear transformations of \u03b2 . This new estimator greatly relaxes the common assumptions for high dimensional problems, and is adaptive to the degree of sparsity of \u03b2 and strength of correlations among the predictors. In particular, \u03b2 can be sparse or non-sparse and predictors can be strongly or weakly correlated. The proposed method is simple for implementation. Numerical and theoretical results demonstrate the competitive advantages of the proposed method for a wide range of problems.",

MelaMEd enables participants to i) recognize skin lesions that require specialist dermatological assessment, ii) select patients at high risk of melanoma and iii) be informed of the diagnosis and treatment pathway of patients with melanoma. A free online platform and online course were developed and launched in June 2022. Before starting the course, enrolled participants fill out a pre-training questionnaire concerning the basic knowledge of the disease and the recognition and management of suspicious lesions. After the course, participants will fill out the same questionnaire again. The online course will end in December 2023. Here we present a preliminary analysis of the pre-training results (January 2023-July 2023). The data have been analyzed descriptively. So far, five healthcare centers have participated in the project for a total of 1320 participants. Of these, 298 compiled the pre-training questionnaire. Forty-seven percent of them were aged <40 years. Respondents were almost divided between GPs (47%) and resident GPs (48%). Among the theoretical questions, the ABCDE rule and ugly duckling sign are well known (96% and 91% of correct answers, respectively), but a lower percentage (68%) of respondents knows the EFG rule for the recognition of nodular melanomas and the statement of Breslow thickness (29%). Regarding the series of clinical images of pigmented skin lesions and their management, the percentages rate of accuracy varied from 33% to 87%: melanoma (5 cases) ranges from 36% to 71%, melanocytic nevi (3 cases) from 33% to 84%, whereas the percentages rate of referral for dermatological evaluation varied from 44% to 99%. Melanoma cases referred to dermatologist ranges from 67% to 99%. This preliminary analysis on pre-train-ing questionnaire mainly showed a lack of knowledge of the two major points of melanoma diagnosis (EFG) and management (Breslow thickness), as well as a low rate of participants. We will compare the proportions of correct answers to the questionnaires before and after the course once available.",

It has been estimated that about 416 000 new cases and over 117 000 deaths of breast cancer occurred in China in 2020. Among the new cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year, 3-10% have distant metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis. In addition, approximately 30% of patients with early-stage breast cancer may eventually experience recurrence or metastases. The 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced breast cancer is only 20% with a median overall survival of 2-3 years. Although advanced breast cancer remains incurable at present, new therapeutic options and multidisciplinary treatment could be utilized to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and prolong patients' survival. The choice of treatment regimens for patients with advanced breast cancer is very important, and the optimal treatment strategy beyond the first- and second-line therapy is often lacking. Herein, the China Advanced Breast Cancer Guideline Panel discussed and summarized recent clinical evidence, updated the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced breast cancer based on the 2020 edition, and formulated the \"Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of advanced breast cancer in China (2022 edition)\" for clinicians' reference.",

However, the widespread use of the 22C3 pharmDx assay is limited due to its availability. Thus, alternative PD-L1 assays are needed. We aimed to investigate the analytical and clinical diagnostic performances of four PD-L1 assays and to compare their concordances with the 22C3 pharmDx assay. The PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx assay was performed on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform, three testing assays (PD-L1 E1L3N XP antibody [Ab], PD-L1 BP6099 Ab and PD-L1 CST E1L3N Ab) on the Leica BOND-MAX/III platform, and one testing assay (PD-L1 MXR006 Ab) on the Roche VENTANA Benchmark Ultra platform. A total of 218 ESCC cases from four centers were included in this retrospective study. Professionals from each center stained and read the IHC slides independently and determined the combined positive score (CPS) and the tumor proportion score (TPS). Regarding analytical performance, the four testing assays demonstrated good correlations with the 22C3 pharmDx assay when evaluated by the TPS or CPS (\u03c1 > 0.8 for all four assays). Regarding diagnostic performance (CPS \u2265 10 was used as the cutoff), the four testing assays showed moderate concordances with the 22C3 pharmDx assay (kappa > 0.7 for all four assays). The overall percent agreements between each testing assay and the 22C3 pharmDx assay was at least 87.2 %. This study provides insight into the potential interchangeability of the four PD-L1 assays with the 22C3 pharmDx assay.",

        "AbstractText": "FK506-binding protein 9 (FKBP9) is involved in tumor malignancy by resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the up-regulation of FKBP9 is associated with patients' poor prognosis. The current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms is still limited. One previous study showed that FKBP9 could confer glioblastoma cell resistance to ER stress through ASK1-p38 signaling. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of FKBP9 expression is still indistinct. In this study, we identified the FKBP9 binding proteins using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Results showed that FKBP9 interacted with the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). BiP bound directly to FKBP9 with high affinity. BiP prolonged the half-life of the FKBP9 protein and stabilized the FKBP9 protein. BiP and FKBP9 protein levels were positively correlated in patients with glioma, and patients with high expression of BiP and FKBP9 showed a worse prognosis. Further studies showed that FKBP9 knockout in genetically engineered mice inhibited intracranial glioblastoma formation and prolonged survival by decreasing cellular proliferation and ER stress-induced CHOP-related apoptosis. Moreover, normal cells may depend less on FKBP9, as shown by the absence of apoptosis upon FKBP9 knockdown in a non-transformed human cell line and overall normal development in homozygous knockout mice. These findings suggest an important role of BiP-regulated FKBP9-associated signaling in glioma progression and the BiP-FKBP9 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.",

        "AbstractText": "Iatrogenic stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common complication of surgical treatment of prostate cancer, regardless of operative approach, and has a major impact on patients' quality of life. Although SUI can occur after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically transurethral prostate resection, laser enucleation of the prostate, and simple open prostatectomy, these therapeutic modalities play a much less significant role in the etiology of SUI. Artificial urethral sphincter (AUS) implantation is considered the standard treatment modality providing high success rates, including durable efficacy, and optimal patient satisfaction for moderate to severe urinary incontinence resulting mainly from radical prostatectomy. However, although complication rates are generally acceptably low, revision and/or explantation may be required due to mechanical failure and non-mechanical problems, specifically urethral atrophy/cuff deficient occlusion, infection, and cuff erosion. Several risk factors for AUS failure associated with a fragile, compromised urethra have been identified and these play a critical role in device cuff erosion and subsequent removal of the device. Among others, apparently the most impacting factors are irradiation, urethral stent placement, a previous AUS placement, and importantly presence of urethral stricture or prior urethroplasty. Generally, any clinical situation leading to a diseased urethra or lack of urethral integrity is associated with impaired local blood perfusion, and consequently lower success rates. The present review aims to evaluate the impact of the presence of prior urethral strictures and urethroplasty on the outcomes of AUS implantation on one hand, and vice-versa, the influence of AUS placement on later urethral stricture surgery, particularly following cuff erosion.",

        "AbstractText": "Although the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) has demonstrated successful outcomes in treating male stress urinary incontinence (SUI) for the past five decades, this procedure also carries inherent risks, including recurrent SUI, device malfunction, local tissue compromise, and infection/erosion, all of which may require revision surgery with or without device replacement. Patients that are at the highest risk for such untoward events often possess unhealthy urethral tissue (termed a \"fragile urethra\") that is compromised and unable to provide optimal cuff coaptation and continence. Accordingly, there are several techniques to address recalcitrant SUI in the setting of a fragile urethra to afford an improved chance of return to continence. Here, we review characteristics of patients that are at higher risk for an untoward outcome following AUS implantation and further define strategies to promote optimal success with device implantation. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature and describe surgical options for male SUI in patients with known or anticipated urethral tissue compromise. A thorough literature review was completed by querying PubMed for relevant articles. Search terms included artificial urinary sphincter, failure, recalcitrant, urethral atrophy, fragile urethra, revision, radiation, cystectomy, incontinence, and/or urethroplasty published between 1975 and 2022. Options for management of the fragile urethra include cuff relocation, cuff downsizing, tandem cuff placement, transcorporal cuff placement, pressure regulating balloon exchange with increased or decreased pressure, bulbospongiosus preservation, sub-cuff ventral capsulotomy, urethral wrapping with graft, and in select cases, urinary diversion, or complete device removal with a return to SUI. Proper patient selection is paramount to optimize outcomes. Advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are reviewed. Numerous techniques are viable options for patients with recalcitrant SUI in the setting of a fragile urethra, but high-quality evidence with reproducible outcomes for many of these strategies remain limited. Proper patient selection as well as adequate counseling by experienced implant surgeons may help optimize outcomes. Further multi-institutional investigations with longer term outcomes are needed to improve patient selection and counseling with shared decision-making prior to any intervention.",

Notably, existing research has demonstrated that TE is associated with subsequent obesity. However, there is a dearth of literature looking at this relationship in college students who are at increased risk. Given this increased risk, there is a need to identify protective factors in the wake of TE that may buffer against the adverse impacts of TE on physical health outcomes. As such, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between college onset TE on subsequent BMI, and to examine psychological resilience as a buffer in this relationship. Trauma exposed college students (N= 2,281, Mage=18.5, 61.6% female, 50.3% identifying as racial/ethnic minorities) completed measures of TE, weight, height, and resilience. Individuals completed measures at baseline and at spring follow-up time points each year after. Resilience was assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and both new onset TE and BMI were assessed at Y2, Y3, and Y4. There was no significant main effect of new onset TE on BMI, nor an interaction between resilience and new onset TE. There was a main effect of resilience on later BMI, whereby those with higher levels of reported resilience reported higher BMI in subsequent years (Y2: B=.36, p<.05; Y3: B= .37= p<.01). The positive association between resilience and BMI is not consistent with our hypotheses. Findings suggest that resilience does not buffer against physical health outcomes.",

In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy is an emerging optical technology that offers promise for the diagnosis of disease & has the capability to quickly, noninvasively and quantitatively probe the biochemical and morphological changes that occur as tissue becomes dysplastic. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from December 2019 to September 2021 in the OBGY Department, UISEMH, in collaboration with optical imaging laboratory, BIOPHOTONICS, IIT Kanpur. A fabricated in-house fluorescence spectroscope consisting of a laser diode (405\u00a0nm) as light source and a miniature spectrometer is used to detect fluorescence signal from the sample. Patient's cervix was examined in the OPD, using an optical handheld probe, which functions on the principle of polarized fluorescence spectroscopy. The tissues were examined and classified on the basis of varying patterns of polarized spectroscopy (co-polarized, cross-polarized and co-minus cross-polarized light). The results were compared with that of cytological, colposcopy and histopathological findings and on various demographic variables. In vivo handheld probe based on polarized fluorescence spectroscopy is an excellent screening technique. Co- and cross- polarized light has shown enhanced accuracy. Accuracy of co-minus cross-polarized light is poor. It is fast, noninvasive and quantitative and, with further developments, has the potential to become a regular screening tool in future.",

The ability to better visualize both tumors and healthy tissues due to excellent soft tissue contrast combined with new possibilities regarding motion management and the capability of online adaptive radiotherapy might increase tumor control rates while potentially reducing the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. As conventional computed tomography (CT)-based image guidance methods are insufficient for adaptive workflows in abdominal tumors, MRgRT appears to be an optimal method for this tumor site. The aim of this narrative review is to outline the opportunities and challenges in magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy in gastrointestinal cancers. We searched for studies, reviews and conceptual articles, including the general technique of MRgRT and the specific utilization in gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on pancreatic cancer, liver metastases and primary liver cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer. This review is highlighting the innovative approach of MRgRT in gastrointestinal cancer and gives an overview of the currently available literature with regard to clinical experiences and theoretical background. MRgRT is a promising new tool in radiation oncology, which can play off several of its beneficial features in the specific field of gastrointestinal cancers. However, clinical data is still scarce. Nevertheless, the available literature points out large potential for improvements regarding dose coverage and escalation as well as the reduction of dose exposure to critical organs at risk (OAR).

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive highly conformal radiation technique that enables the delivery of large doses of radiation in a few fractions to well-defined targets using image-guidance and motion management. For selected patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases, stereotactic body radiation therapy can be delivered safely, with excellent long-term local control and overall survival. The purpose of this clinical practice review is to review the background, indications, and treatment details of stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. SBRT for colorectal cancer liver metastases may be considered for patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer in combination with surgery or other locally ablative therapies; for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection; or after failure of resection or other ablative therapies. When planning SBRT both a computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging simulation may be obtained, where feasible, for target delineation. One or 3 fraction SBRT can be considered for lesions away from the central liver and luminal organs at risk, whereas 5 fraction SBRT is preferred otherwise. Image-guidance and motion management strategies are essential components of liver SBRT and will guide the creation of relevant internal and planning target volume margins. For lesions in close proximity to or overlapping with organs-at-risk, the balance between adequate local control and potential for cure with potential acute and late toxicity must be carefully considered.",

Images of PET/CT performed between January 2008 and December 2019 on recently diagnosed oncologic patients were reviewed searching for MP. MP was defined as increased density and volume of mesenteric root fat, associated with nodules and/or lymph nodes, with or without pseudocapsule. Patients who had received previous cancer treatment or those with synchronous or metachronous malignancies were excluded. The frequency of MP in the total oncologic population was 5,3 % (82/1539). Types of cancer frequently associated with MP were non-Hodgkin lymphoma at 15,9% (31/195) and prostate cancer at 11,9% (16/134), both significantly higher than the rest of the malignancies (p < 0,01). Hodgkin Lymphoma (0/59), carcinoma of the cervix (0/45), and endometrial cancer (0/44) did not show MP. MP is more frequently associated with some malignant neoplasms, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer, and rare in others.

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (PGISTs) are exceptionally rare, accounting for <5% of extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs) and <1% of malignant pancreatic neoplasms. We present a unique case of concurrent double primary malignancies in a 46-year-old female with a history of recurrent myoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland, managed through surgical resection and adjuvant therapy. She presented with an enlarging abdominal mass, initially suggestive of pancreatic metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin (SMA) and CD34 in both parotid and pancreatic tissues. Importantly, CD117 expression was confined to the pancreatic tissue, confirming the diagnosis of PGIST rather than metastasis. Subsequently, a splenic-sparing distal pancreatectomy was performed, followed by immediate imatinib therapy. This case underscores the potential for the coexistence of rare primary malignancies with unique histopathological characteristics and organ involvement. When encountering a newly developed lesion in a distant organ, surgeons must consider the possibility of metastasis to guide therapeutic decision-making. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention are paramount, particularly in the case of PGIST, given its infrequent presentation and clinical complexities.",

Harnessing their antimicrobial powers, without driving excessive and damaging inflammatory responses, represents an attractive therapeutic possibility. The neutrophil population is increasingly recognised to be more diverse and malleable than was previously appreciated. Hypoxic signalling pathways are known to regulate important neutrophil behaviours and, as such, are potential therapeutic targets for regulating neutrophil antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. We used a combination of in vivo and ex vivo models, utilising neutrophil and myeloid specific PHD1 or PHD3 deficient mouse lines to investigate the roles of oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylase enzymes in the regulation of neutrophilic inflammation and immunity. Mass spectrometry and Seahorse metabolic flux assays were used to analyse the role of metabolic shifts in driving the downstream phenotypes. We found that PHD1 deficiency drives alterations in neutrophil metabolism and recruitment, in an oxygen dependent fashion. Despite this, PHD1 deficiency did not significantly alter ex vivo neutrophil phenotypes or in vivo outcomes in mouse models of inflammation. Conversely, PHD3 deficiency was found to enhance neutrophil antibacterial properties without excessive inflammatory responses. This was not linked to changes in the abundance of core metabolites but was associated with increased oxygen consumption and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. PHD3 deficiency drives a favourable neutrophil phenotype in infection and, as such, is an important potential therapeutic target.",

We used arsenic exposure estimates up to 60 years prior to study entry and compared the goodness of fit of models using these mixtures to those using summary measures of arsenic exposures. We used the Bayesian index low rank kriging multiple membership model (LRK-MMM) to estimate the associations of these mixtures with bladder cancer and estimate cumulative spatial risk for bladder cancer using participants' residential histories. We found consistent evidence that modeling arsenic exposures as a time-varying mixture provided better fit to the data than using a single arsenic exposure summary measure. We estimated several positive though not significant associations of the time-varying arsenic mixtures with bladder cancer having odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03-1.14 and identified many significant and positive associations for an interaction among those who consumed water from a private dug well (ORs 1.28-1.60).

The WHO pain ladder has been used in practice to guide cancer pain management. A three-step ladder starts with NSAIDs and non-opioids for mild pain, weak opioids for mild to moderate pain and strong opioids for moderate to severe pain with the use of adjuvant medications such as TCAs and muscle relaxants at any stage for optimization (Fallon et al., Dec 2022) [2] We present a case of a patient with metastatic colon cancer who was admitted for intractable pain crisis and right sided L-5 radiculopathy secondary to epidural metastasis (Figs. 1 and 2).

However, the risk for radiation-induced complications, such as radiation-induced lumbar radiculopathy, is not fully understood and requires further investigation. We present a 68-year-old man with delayed-onset lumbosacral polyradiculitis following proton precision beam therapy for localized prostate cancer. The patient underwent proton therapy treatment for the prostate and seminal vesicles with favorable results and tumor remission. However, five months after completing radiation therapy, the patient presented with chronic lower extremity pain, weakness, and bilateral lower extremity paresthesias. MRI showed diffuse hyperintensity of bilateral L5-S3 nerve roots and an intramuscular edema-like signal involving the bilateral obturator externus and internus muscles, likely due to radiation.

This IRB-approved retrospective single-center study investigated the opioid consumption of 26 adults at three different times: (1) Initial date of service-baseline- (2) SCS implant date, and (3) 6 months post-SCS implant date. Mean opioid consumption was calculated over the month prior and after to visit of (1), (2), and (3) to generate 3 separate month averages.

Targeted therapy is an essential strategy; however, the effectiveness of targeted drugs is often limited by drug resistance, posing a significant dilemma in clinical practice. Targeted protein degradation technologies, including proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have great potential in overcoming drug resistance and targeting undruggable targets. These areas of research are gaining increasing attention to various epigenetic related disease. In this review, we have provided a summary of the recently developed degraders targeting epigenetic readers, writers, and erasers. Additionally, we have outlined new applications for epigenetic protein degraders. Finally, we have addressed several unresolved challenges within the PROTAC field and offered potential solutions from our perspective. As the field continues to advance, the integration of these innovative methodologies holds great promise for addressing the challenges associated with PROTAC development.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A comprehensive review of animal models for cancer cachexia: Implications for translational research.",
        "AbstractText": "Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive weight loss and a disease process that nutritional support cannot reverse. Although progress has been made in preclinical research, there is still a long way to go in translating research findings into clinical practice. One of the main reasons for this is that existing preclinical models do not fully replicate the conditions seen in clinical patients. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of existing preclinical models of cancer cachexia and pay close attention to the latest developments in preclinical models. The main models of cancer cachexia used in current research are allogeneic and xenograft models, genetically engineered mouse models, chemotherapy drug-induced models, Chinese medicine spleen deficiency models, zebrafish and Drosophila models, and cellular models. This review aims to revisit and summarize the commonly used animal models of cancer cachexia by evaluating existing preclinical models, to provide tools and support for translational medicine research.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Follicular DNA Damage and Pesticide Exposure Among Latinx Children in Rural and Urban Communities.",
        "AbstractText": "The intersectional risks of children in United States immigrant communities include environmental exposures. Pesticide exposures and their biological outcomes are not well characterized in this population group. We assessed pesticide exposure and related these exposures to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Latinx children from rural, farmworker families (FW; N\u2009=\u200930) and from urban, non-farmworker families (NFW; N\u2009=\u200915) living in North Carolina. DSBs were quantified in hair follicular cells by immunostaining of 53BP1, and exposure to 72 pesticides and pesticide degradation products were determined using silicone wristbands. Cholinesterase activity was measured in blood samples. DSB frequencies were higher in FW compared to NFW children. Seasonal effects were detected in the FW group, with highest DNA damage levels in April-June and lowest levels in October-November. Acetylcholinesterase depression had the same seasonality and correlated with follicular DNA damage. Organophosphate pesticides were more frequently detected in FW than in NFW children. Participants with organophosphate detections had increased follicular DNA damage compared to participants without organophosphate detection. Follicular DNA damage did not correlate with organochlorine or pyrethroid detections and was not associated with the total number of pesticides detected in the wristbands. These results point to rural disparities in pesticide exposures and their outcomes in children from vulnerable immigrant communities. They suggest that among the different classes of pesticides, organophosphates have the strongest genotoxic effects. Assessing pesticide exposures and their consequences at the individual level is key to environmental surveillance programs. To this end, the minimally invasive combined approach used here is particularly well suited for children. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12403-023-00609-1.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Considerations and targeted approaches to identifying bad actors in exposure mixtures.",
        "AbstractText": "Variable importance is a key statistical issue in exposure mixtures, as it allows a ranking of exposures as potential targets for intervention, and helps to identify bad actors within a mixture. In settings where mixtures have many constituents or high between-constituent correlations, estimators of importance can be subject to bias or high variance. Current approaches to assessing variable importance have major limitations, including reliance on overly strong or incorrect constraints or assumptions, excessive model extrapolation, or poor interpretability, especially regarding practical significance. We sought to overcome these limitations by applying an established doubly-robust, machine learning-based approach to estimating variable importance in a mixtures context. This method reduces model extrapolation, appropriately controls confounding, and provides both interpretability and model flexibility. We illustrate its use with an evaluation of the relationship between telomere length, a measure of biologic aging, and exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans among 979 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In contrast with standard approaches for mixtures, our approach selected PCB 180 and PCB 194 as important contributors to telomere length. We hypothesize that this difference could be due to residual confounding in standard methods that rely on variable selection. Further empirical evaluation of this method is needed, but it is a promising tool in the search for bad actors within a mixture.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Genome-wide association study of susceptibility to hospitalised respiratory infections.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Globally, respiratory infections contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. However, genetic determinants of respiratory infections are understudied and remain poorly understood. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study in 19,459 hospitalised respiratory infection cases and 101,438 controls from UK Biobank (Stage 1). We followed-up well-imputed top signals from our Stage 1 analysis in 50,912 respiratory infection cases and 150,442 controls from 11 cohorts (Stage 2). We aggregated effect estimates across studies using inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses. Additionally, we investigated the function of the top signals in order to gain understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Results: From our Stage 1 analysis, we report 56 signals at P<5\u00d710 -6, one of which was genome-wide significant ( P<5\u00d710 -8). The genome-wide significant signal was in an intron of PBX3, a gene that encodes pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 3, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. Further, the genome-wide significant signal was found to colocalise with gene-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) affecting expression of PBX3 in lung tissue, where the respiratory infection risk alleles were associated with decreased PBX3 expression in lung tissue, highlighting a possible biological mechanism. Of the 56 signals, 40 were well-imputed in UK Biobank and were investigated in Stage 2. None of the 40 signals replicated, with effect estimates attenuated. Conclusions: Our Stage 1 analysis implicated PBX3 as a candidate causal gene and suggests a possible role of transcription factor binding activity in respiratory infection susceptibility. However, the PBX3 signal, and the other well-imputed signals, did not replicate in the meta-analysis of Stages 1 and 2. Significant phenotypic heterogeneity and differences in study ascertainment may have contributed to this lack of statistical replication. Overall, our study highlighted putative associations and possible biological mechanisms that may provide insight into respiratory infection susceptibility.",

        "AbstractText": "Adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are at high risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality and have suboptimal influenza vaccine immune responses compared to healthy adults, particularly within 2 years of transplant. This phase II, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial compared 2 doses of high-dose trivalent (HD-TIV) to 2 doses of standard-dose quadrivalent (SD-QIV) influenza vaccine administered 1 month apart in adults 3-23 months post-allogeneic HCT. Hemagglutinin antibody inhibition (HAI) titers were measured at baseline, 4 weeks following each vaccine dose, and approximately 7 months post-second vaccination. Injection-site and systemic reactions were assessed for 7 days post-vaccination. The primary immunogenicity comparison was geometric mean HAI titer (GMT) at visit 3 (4 weeks after the second dose); we used linear mixed models to estimate adjusted GMT ratios (aGMRs) comparing HD-TIV/SD-QIV for each antigen. We randomized 124 adults; 64 received SD-QIV and 60 received HD-TIV. Following the second vaccination, HD-TIV was associated with higher GMTs compared to SD-QIV for A/H3N2 (aGMR = 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.19, 3.68]) and B/Victoria (aGMR = 1.61; 95% CI: [1.00, 2.58]). The increase was not statistically significant for A/H1N1 (aGMR = 1.16; 95% CI: [0.67, 2.02]). There was a trend to more injection-site reactions for HD-TIV after the second vaccination compared to SD-QIV (50% vs 33%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.53; 95% CI: [0.71, 28.9]), whereas systemic reactions were similar between groups with both injections. Adult allogeneic HCT recipients who received 2 doses of HD-TIV produced higher HAI antibody responses for A/H3N2 and B/Victoria compared with 2 doses of SD-QIV, with comparable injection-site or systemic reactions.",

This cross-sectional study included 61 BD patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The patients were categorised into two groups based on the presence or absence of vascular involvement. Demographic data, disease duration, disease activity, and medical treatments were recorded. Disease activity was evaluated using the Beh\u00e7et's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) and the Beh\u00e7et's Syndrome Activity Scale (BSAS). The expression levels of miRNAs were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

However, the expression levels of miR-195, miR-424, miR-10b, miR-103a-3p, and miR-542-3p were significantly higher in BD patients than in healthy controls (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.010, p<0.01, p=0.039, respectively). Moreover, the expression level of miR-195 was significantly higher in vasculo-Beh\u00e7et patients than in the other groups (p=0.0318). However, no significant association was found between the expression levels of miR-195 and clinical activity.

Diameter size and zeta potential distribution were studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The morphology of isolated Exos was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Using western blotting, protein levels of exosomal tetraspanins were detected. For the in vivo study, Dil-labeled normal and cancer Exos were injected into the tail vein (100 \u00b5g exosomal protein/rat) three times at 1-hour intervals. After 24 hours, rats were euthanized and the cellular uptake of Exos was monitored in different organs using immunofluorescence staining (IF). The size distribution and mean zeta potential of HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 cells Exos were 80\u00b129.94 and 64.77\u00b125.49 nm, and -7.58 and -11.8 mV, respectively. Western blotting revealed CD9, CD81, and CD63 in normal and cancer Exos. The SEM images exhibited typical nano-sized round-shape Exo particles. IF staining indicated sequestration of administrated Exos in splenic tissue and lungs. The distribution of Exo in kidneys, aorta, and hepatic tissue was less. These features were more evident in the group that received cancer Exos. We found no obvious adverse effects in rats that received normal or cancer Exos. Normal and cancerous xenogeneic human Exos can be sequestrated prominently in splenic tissue and lungs. Novel delivery approaches and engineering tools are helpful in the target delivery of administrated Exos to the injured sites.",

In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time. A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALYs (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable\u00a0diseases\u00a0(NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity.

        "AbstractText": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined by the presence of a cancer-associated somatic mutation in white blood cells in the absence of overt hematological malignancy. It arises most commonly from loss-of-function mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A and TET2. CHIP predisposes to both hematological malignancies and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. Here we demonstrate that loss of Dnmt3a in myeloid cells increased murine atherosclerosis to a similar degree as previously seen with loss of Tet2. Loss of Dnmt3a enhanced inflammation in macrophages in vitro and generated a distinct adventitial macrophage population in vivo which merges a resident macrophage profile with an inflammatory cytokine signature. These changes surprisingly phenocopy the effect of loss of Tet2. Our results identify a common pathway promoting heightened innate immune cell activation with loss of either gene, providing a biological basis for the excess atherosclerotic disease burden in carriers of these two most prevalent CHIP mutations.",

Here we show that MCM8 expression is significantly decreased in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) who developed coronary artery aneurysms. Mechanistically, we discovered that nitric oxide signaling promotes TRIM21-mediated MCM8 ubiquitination, which disrupts its interaction with MCM9 and promotes its cytosolic export. In the cytosol, MCM8 relocates to the mitochondria pore-forming proteins and promotes their ubiquitination by TRIM21. In addition, MCM8 directly recruits LC3 via its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif and initiates mitophagy. This suppresses mitochondrial DNA-mediated activation of type I interferon via cGAS and STING. Mice that are deficient in Mcm8, Trim21 and Nos2 or reconstituted with the East-Asian-specific MCM8-P276 variant develop more severe coronary artery vasculopathy in the Lactobacillus casei extract-induced KD model.

Patients with International Classification of Retinoblastoma groups C-E retinoblastoma at a single institution from 2001 to 2021 were categorized into two groups: primary enucleation and globe salvage. Hospital visits and treatments were compared to determine differences in care utilization. Costs per encounter were derived from billing data and multiplied by number of encounters to determine total costs in the first year of treatment. Groups were stratified by unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma, and visual acuity-based utility values were used to compare quality-adjusted life years to determine cost-effectiveness. Of 74 group C-E eyes of 70 patients, 55 eyes underwent primary enucleation and 19 eyes underwent globe salvage, 12 of which ultimately underwent secondary enucleation. Patients who underwent globe salvage had higher usage of systemic chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), more examinations under anesthesia (P < 0.001), fewer outpatient visits (P\u00a0= 0.03), and a higher total cost of care (301,151 vs 104,764 USD [P < 0.001]) in the first year of treatment compared with the primary enucleation group. At an average life expectancy of 76 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 118,347 USD per QALY in unilateral retinoblastoma and 32,987 USD per QALY in bilateral retinoblastoma, meeting the <150,000 USD/QALY threshold of cost-effectiveness. Incurring additional costs may save the eye in advanced retinoblastoma, but the possibility of secondary enucleation should be disclosed for informed decision making.

A relative risk (RR) of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.59-0.76) was observed between 2005 and 2009, 0.76 (95%CI: 0.67-0.87) from 2005 on, and 1.44 (95%CI: 1.25-1.68) from 2015 on. The cohorts from 1910 to 1924 presented a risk reduction (RR < 1), when compared to the reference cohort (1935). Regarding the time period, the creation of public policies and the establishment of guidelines are suggested as factors which may have contributed to more access to diagnosis, in consonance with the cohort effect. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological scenario of prostate cancer in regions that are more vulnerable in terms of socioeconomic conditions.

        "AbstractText": "The scope of this article was to analyze the five-year survival rate among patients with laryngeal cancer treated in the Unified Health System in Brazil and its regions between January 2002 and June 2010. There is still scarce information in Brazil regarding the scale and survival rate of laryngeal cancer patients, which makes it difficult to adopt specific strategies for the control of the condition in the country. A retrospective cohort study based on the National Oncology Database was conducted, and the survival probability rate for laryngeal cancer according to age, sex and Brazilian regions/states was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to assess the differences observed, considering a 5% significance level. Survival in Brazil was estimated at 50.8% (95%CI: 49.9%-51.8%), being lower among male patients (49.1%; 95%CI: 48.10%-50.16%); between 50 and 60 years of age (48.4%; 95%CI: 46.7%-50.0%); for residents of the Northern region (45.5%; 95%CI: 39.5%-51.3%). The regional variation in the survival rate for laryngeal cancer in Brazil reveals disparities between Brazilian regions/states that may be linked to inequality of access to diagnosis and/or treatment.

It describes the first results from 1 group of patients in the phase 1 CHRYSALIS study with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations. This part of the CHRYSALIS study (called cohort D) investigated the bispecific antibody amivantamab (brand name RYBREVANT\u00ae) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR ex20ins mutation. EGFR mutations are one of the most common causes of NSCLC tumors, with EGFR ex20ins mutations being more common among people of Asian descent. Patients who took part in this study had cancer that could not be removed by surgery, and whose cancer had worsened after receiving other forms of treatment, such as chemotherapy. Typically, patients with this type of mutation are difficult to treat or do not experience treatment response with commonly used therapies that target EGFR.What were the results? The CHRYSALIS study took place between May 27, 2016, and June 8, 2020, in select hospitals in the USA, Japan and South Korea. In cohort D, amivantamab showed promising results, with an overall response rate of 40%. This means that 4 of every 10 patients in CHRYSALIS cohort D had tumors that shrank or were no longer measurable.

Although the role of biomaterials at the molecular and cellular scales has been studied, research investigating the effects of biomaterials across multiple dimensional scales is relatively scarce. Herein, comparing the effectiveness of two-dimensional graphene oxide nanosheets (GOs) and three-dimensional graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) (though not zero-dimensional because of their significant surface area) in cancer therapies, we have discovered that GOs, with the same mass concentration, exhibit stronger anti-cancer and anti-tumor metastasis properties than GOQDs. Our research, which employed liquid-phase atomic force microscopy, revealed that lower-dimensional GOs create a more extensive nano-bio interface that impedes actin protein polymerization into the cytoskeleton, leading to the prevention of tumor metastasis. These results help to better understand the underlying mechanisms and offer a dimensional perspective on the potential of optimizing the properties of graphene-based materials for clinical applications, e.g., cancer therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Complete regeneration of damaged tissues/organs has always been the ultimate challenge in regenerative medicine. Aging has long been considered the basis of age-related diseases, as senescent cells gradually accumulate in tissues with increasing age, tissues exhibit aging and normal physiological functions are inhibited. In recent years, in damaged tissues, scholars have found that the number of cells with features of cellular senescence continues to increase over time. The accumulation of senescent cells severely hinders the healing of damaged tissues. Furthermore, by clearing senescent cells or inhibiting the aging microenvironment, damaged tissues regained their original regenerative and repair capabilities. On the other hand, various biomaterials have been proved to have good biocompatibility and can effectively support cell regeneration after injury. Combining the two solutions, inhibiting the cellular senescence in damaged tissues and establishing a pro-regenerative environment through biomaterial technology gradually reveals a new, unexpected treatment strategy applied to the field of regenerative medicine. In this review, we first elucidate the main characteristics of senescent cells from morphological, functional and molecular levels, and discuss in detail the process of accumulation of senescent cells in tissues. Then, we will explore in depth how the accumulation of senescent cells after damage affects tissue repair and regeneration at different stages. Finally, we will turn to how to promote tissue regeneration and repair in the field of regenerative medicine by inhibiting cellular senescence combined with biomaterial technology. Our goal is to understand the relationship between cellular senescence and tissue regeneration through this new perspective, and provide valuable references for the development of new therapeutic strategies in the future.",

However, hydrophobic fullerenes can only be dispersed in organic solvents which hinders their biomedical applications. Here, we report a facile method to prepare highly water-dispersible fullerene (C60)-polymer nanoparticles with hydrodynamic sizes of 50-70\u00a0nm. Hydrophilic random copolymers containing different ratios of polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate and 2-aminoethylmethacrylamide were synthesized for conjugating with C60 molecules through efficient nucleophilic Michael addition reaction between amine groups from hydrophilic polymer and carbon-carbon double bonds from C60. As a result, the amphiphilic C60-polymer conjugates could be well dispersed and nano-assembled in water with a C60 concentration as high as 7.8\u00a0mg/mL, demonstrating a significant improvement for the solubility of C60 in an aqueous system. Owing to the high C60 content, the C60-polymer nanoparticles showed a strong photodynamic therapy effect on human lung cancer cells (A549) under light irradiation (450\u00a0nm) in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid culture, while demonstrating ignorable cytotoxicity under dark. This highly efficient and convenient method to prepare water-dispersible C60-polymer conjugates may have a great impact on the future biomedical applications of fullerenes.",

An experienced genitourinary radiologist re-reported his original 100 consecutive mpMRIp scans using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) after 5 years of further experience comprising >1000 scans. Intraobserver agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy were calculated, and comparison of sensitivity was performed using McNemar's test. Ninety-six mpMRIp scans were included in our final analysis. Of the 96 patients, 53\u00a0(55.2%) patients underwent subsequent biopsy (n=43) or prostatectomy (n=15), with 73 lesions targeted. Moderate agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.55) was seen in the number of lesions identified at initial reporting and on re-reading (81 vs. 39 total lesions; and 71 vs. 37 number of PI-RADS \u22653 lesions). For clinically significant prostate cancer, re-reading demonstrated an increase in specificity (from 43% to 89%) and PPV (from 62% to 87%), but a decrease in sensitivity (from 94% to 72%, p=0.01) and NPV (from 89% to 77%). The intraobserver agreement for a novice to experienced radiologist reporting mpMRIp using PI-RADS v2 is moderate. Reduced sensitivity is off-set by improved specificity and PPV, which validate mpMRIp as a gold standard for prebiopsy screening.",

        "AbstractText": "In the absence of data from a randomized trial, researchers may aim to use observational data to draw causal inference about the effect of a treatment on a time-to-event outcome. In this context, interest often focuses on the treatment-specific survival curves, that is, the survival curves were the population under study to be assigned to receive the treatment or not. Under certain conditions, including that all confounders of the treatment-outcome relationship are observed, the treatment-specific survival curve can be identified with a covariate-adjusted survival curve. In this article, we propose a novel cross-fitted doubly-robust estimator that incorporates data-adaptive (e.g. machine learning) estimators of the conditional survival functions. We establish conditions on the nuisance estimators under which our estimator is consistent and asymptotically linear, both pointwise and uniformly in time. We also propose a novel ensemble learner for combining multiple candidate estimators of the conditional survival estimators. Notably, our methods and results accommodate events occurring in discrete or continuous time, or an arbitrary mix of the two. We investigate the practical performance of our methods using numerical studies and an application to the effect of a surgical treatment to prevent metastases of parotid carcinoma on mortality.",

Risk assessment associated with human contact with the soil was carried out using hazard quotient (HQ) and incremental life cancer risk (ILCR) from human unconscious ingestion and dermal contact with the soil. Soil samples were obtained at different automobile workshops in Ado-Ekiti, Western Nigeria. The PAHS in the samples were extracted using dichloromethane and extracts were cleaned up using silica-alumina gel open column chromatography. Analysis of PAHs in the soil was done using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector operated on electron ionization mode. The results showed the mean PAHs concentration at the sampling locations ranged from 5.58 - 6.4 \u03bcg/g and the mean \u2211 carcinogenic PAHs was 58.4 \u03bcg/g, equivalent to 59.39 % of total PAHs observed.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4- to 6-ring PAHs) were determined in fine and coarse particles. The gas/particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) of the PAHs were calculated from the supercooled liquid vapour pressure and octanol-air partitioning coefficient based on the relationships obtained in previous traffic pollution-related studies. Gaseous PAHs were estimated by Kp and the concentrations of PM and particulate PAHs. The concentrations of total PAHs were 32.5, 320.1 and 5646.2 pg/m3 in the PM>2.5, PM2.5 and gas phases, respectively. Significant seasonal trends in PAHs were observed (particle phase: lowest in summer, gas phase: lowest in spring, particle and gas phase: lowest in spring). Compared to 2019, the total PAH concentrations (in particles) decreased in 2020, especially in spring and summer, which might be due to reduced traffic trips during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) calculated from the toxic equivalent concentrations relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) was lower than the acceptable limit issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indicating a low cancer risk in long-term exposure to current PAH levels. It is notable that gaseous PAHs considerably contributed to BaPeq and ILCR (over 50%), which highlighted the significance of gaseous PAH monitoring for public health protection. This low-cost estimation method for gaseous PAHs can be expected to reliably and conveniently obtain PAH concentrations as a surrogate for traditional sampling in the future work.",

This research evaluated the incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for respiratory tract cancers using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 database. Age-standardized rates were calculated for TBL cancer from 1990 to 2019, adjusted for smoking and socio-demographic index (SDI). Deaths from TBL cancer and larynx cancer attributable to each risk factor were estimated for 33 Asian countries. The age-standardized incidence and death rates for TBL cancer in Asia declined from 2010 to 2019, while the incidence rate of larynx cancer increased. Smoking was the leading specific risk factor for deaths from both TBL and larynx cancers.

AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, have been deployed extensively for lung nodule detection, benign and malignant classification, and subtype identification based on CT images. Furthermore, AI plays a role in the non-invasive prediction of genetic mutations and molecular status to provide the optimal treatment regimen, and applies to the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of lung cancer patients, enabling precision medicine to become a reality. Meanwhile, histology-based AI models assist pathologists in typing, molecular characterization, and prognosis prediction to enhance the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. However, the leap to extensive clinical application still faces various challenges, such as data sharing, standardized label acquisition, clinical application regulation, and multimodal integration. Nevertheless, AI holds promising potential in the field of lung cancer to improve cancer care.",

Respiratory pathogens are also known to be associated with the initiation and development of lung cancer. Despite the fact that the bacterial biomass in the lungs is lower than that in the intestinal tract, emerging evidence indicates that the lung is colonized by a diverse array of microbes. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the role of dysbiosis of the lung microbiota in the progression of lung cancer. In this review, we summarize the current information about the relationship between the microbiome and lung cancer. The objective is to provide an overview of the core composition of the microbiota in lung cancer as well as the role of specific dysbiosis of the lung microbiota in the progression of lung cancer and treatment of the disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Although examinations and therapies for bronchial lung cancer, also called lung cancer (LC), have become more effective and precise, the morbidity and mortality of LC remain high worldwide. Describing the changing profile of LC characteristics over time is indispensable. This study aimed to understand the changes in real-world settings of LC and its characteristics in China. In this study, 119,785 patients were enrolled from 2012 to 2020 in the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The patients' medical records were extracted from the hospital's database. Demographic characteristics, general clinicopathological information, and blood coagulation indices at the initial diagnoses were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis, Nemenyi, chi-squared, and Bonferroni tests. Changes in demographic characteristics during the 8-year study period, namely dynamic changes among different stages and different pathological types, were evaluated. The percentages of female (from 38.50% [323/839] in 2012 to 48.29% [5112/10,585] in 2020) and non-smoking LC (from 69.34% [475/685] to 80.48% [8055/10,009]) patients increased significantly during the study period, with a trend toward a younger age at diagnosis (from 3.58% [30/839] to 8.99% [952/10,585]). Over the study period, the proportion and absolute number of lung adenocarcinoma cases increased (from 67.97% [433/637] to 76.31% [6606/8657]) while the proportion of lung squamous cell carcinoma decreased (from 21.19% [135/637] to 12.08% [1046/8657]). Comprehensive driver gene mutation examination became more common, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation occurred more frequently in female vs. male (62.03% [12793/20625] vs. 29.90% [8207/27,447]) and non-smoking vs. smoking (53.54% [17,203/32,134] vs. 23.73% [3322/13,997]) patients (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The distribution of the common driver genes differed among different stages of LC. EGFR mutation was detected most frequently at each stage, and other driver gene alterations were more common in advanced stages (P\u00a0<0.001). The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as a comprehensive management regimen, gradually became predominant over the study period (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A hypercoagulable state was shown in advanced-stage LC patients and patients with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion, indicated by significantly elevated levels of d-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation products. This study comprehensively depicted the changing characteristics of Chinese LC patients over an 8-year period to provide preliminary insights into LC treatment.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05423236.",

It addresses the following challenges: in high-dimensional contexts, distributional models can be dubious; in high-signal contexts, conventional permutation tests give poor pairwise comparisons. We also make two other contributions: Based on a careful analysis we find that a balanced permutation approach is more powerful in high-signal contexts than conventional permutations. Another contribution is the quantification of uncertainty due to permutation variation via a bootstrap confidence interval. The practical usefulness of these ideas is illustrated in the comparison of subpopulations of modern cancer data.",

        "AbstractText": "Immunotherapy has emerged as a novel strategy for cancer treatment following surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint blockade and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have been successful in clinical trials. Cancer cells evade immune surveillance by hijacking inhibitory pathways via overexpression of checkpoint genes. The Cluster of Differentiation 47 (CD47) has emerged as a crucial checkpoint for cancer immunotherapy by working as a \"don't eat me\" signal and suppressing innate immune signaling. Furthermore, CD47 is highly expressed in many cancer types to protect cancer cells from phagocytosis via binding to SIRP\u03b1 on phagocytes. Targeting CD47 by either interrupting the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 axis or combing with other therapies has been demonstrated as an encouraging therapeutic strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Antibodies and small molecules that target CD47 have been explored in pre- and clinical trials. However, formidable challenges such as the anemia and palate aggregation cannot be avoided because of the wide presentation of CD47 on erythrocytes. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the regulation and function of CD47, and provides a new perspective for immunotherapy targeting CD47. It also highlights the clinical progress of targeting CD47 and discusses challenges and potential strategies. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of targeting CD47 in cancer immunotherapy, it also augments the concept of combination immunotherapy strategies by employing both innate and adaptive immune responses.",

        "AbstractText": "Epithelial mechanics and mechanobiology have become 2 important research fields in life sciences and bioengineering. These fields investigate how physical factors induced by cell adhesion and collective behaviors can directly regulate biologic processes, such as organ development and disease progression. Cell mechanics and mechanobiology thus make exciting biophysics education topics to illustrate how fundamental physics principles play a role in regulating cell biology. However, the field currently lacks hands-on activities that engage students in learning science and outreach programs in these topics. One such area is the development of robust hands-on modules that allow students to observe features of cell shape and mechanics and connect them to fundamental physics principles. Here, we demonstrate a workflow that engages students in studying epithelial cell mechanics by using commercial histology slides of frog skin. We show that by using recently developed artificial intelligence-based image-segmentation tools, students can easily quantify different cell morphologic features in a high-throughput manner. Using our workflow, students can reproduce 2 essential findings in cell mechanics: the common gamma distribution of normalized cell aspect ratio in jammed epithelia and the constant ratio between the nuclear and cellular area. Importantly, because the only required instrument for this active learning module is a readily available light microscope and a computer, our module is relatively low cost, as well as portable. These features make the module scalable for students at various education levels and outreach programs. This highly accessible education module provides a fun and engaging way to introduce students to the world of epithelial tissue mechanics.",

One previous study found an association between early adversity and trait emotional awareness (EA), which has itself been linked to health outcomes, but links to mental health were not explicitly examined. The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that the association between early adversity and health can be partially accounted for by differences in EA within a large student sample (n = 196). Participants completed measures of early adversity, EA, and current emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anxiety, somatization, positive/negative affect). Bayesian analyses found the most evidence for models with an interaction between sex and early adversity in predicting emotional functioning - revealing the expected negative relationship between early adversity and EA in females, but a positive relationship in males. Early adversity, but not EA, was associated with depression, anxiety, and implicit negative affect. Only explicit positive affect was associated with both early adversity and EA, and EA partially mediated the negative association between early adversity and positive affect. These results provide limited support for EA as a mediating pathway for the effects of early adversity on mental health.",

        "AbstractText": "Curcumin is one of the natural anticancer drugs but its efficiency is limited by low stability, insufficient bioavailability, poor solubility, and poor permeability. Dorema aucheri (Bilhar) is a herb with precious pharmaceutical properties. This study aimed to develop a nanoliposome-based curcumin and Bilhar extract codelivery system. The nanocompounds were synthesized using the lipid thin-film hydration method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering techniques, and their cytotoxicity and apoptotic effect on the primary oral cancer cell line were evaluated via 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry. Moreover, the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in the treated cells was assessed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. Based on the results, nanoliposomes had a size of 91\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009nm with a polydispersity index of 0.13. Free curcumin, the extract, and the curcumin-extract combination showed dose-dependent toxicity against cancer cells; yet, the extract (IC50: 86\u2009\u00b5g/ml) and curcumin-extract (IC50: 65\u2009\u00b5g/ml) activities were much more than curcumin (IC50: 121\u2009\u00b5g/ml). Also, the curcumin and extract loaded on liposomes showed a dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity. After loading the curcumin-extract compound on nanoliposomes, their IC50 decreased from 180\u2009\u00b5g/ml (within 24\u2009hr) to 43\u2009\u00b5g/ml (within 72\u2009hr), indicating their sustainable release and activity. Likewise, this compound induced the highest apoptosis percentage (95%) in cancerous cells and inhibited the expression of the EGFR gene in the cells by 81%\u2009\u00b1\u20093%. These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the Bilhar extract against oral cancer cells.

This will help stakeholders in planning drug development strategies. Data were collected from the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and the World Bank database. An electronic search was done for the total number of trials registered between January 1, 2018, and March 15, 2023. Information was analyzed based on the year of registration, therapeutic area, type of intervention, sponsorship, and type of special population. The trial density indices (TDIs) were calculated based on population (Xi) and gross domestic product (GDP) (Yi) using author-derived formulae. Altogether 2, 77, 536 trials from the BRICS and G7 were registered. China and the US had the most trials among the BRICS and G7, respectively. Between 2018 and 2022, the gap between the BRICS and G7 steadily reduced. The most common indication for clinical trials among the BRICS was cancer. Based on population, the TDI was the highest in China and the lowest in Russia. In proportion to the GDP, the TDI was maximum in Russia and minimum in India. There is a remarkable reduction in the gap in clinical trial trends between the BRICS and G7 nations. Among the BRICS, India and China are at the forefront in drug development. There is scope for improvement in trial density based on India's population and GDP.

An extensive electronic search of the PubMed/PMC and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify all articles published until May 2022, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 95 articles were included in the final analysis after title, abstract, and full-text screening, with additional data obtained from the GLOBOCAN and WHO 2020 databases. Most of the included articles were case-control studies examining the risk factors and molecular mechanisms of BC. These studies originated from 10 different countries, with Egypt being the most active contributor. While BC in the Arab world shares some common risk factors with Western countries, such as smoking and occupational exposure, it also exhibits unique features related to schistosomiasis. The high mortality rates in this region are alarming and can be attributed to various factors, including the prevalence of smoking, the impact of schistosomiasis, a combination of genetic and socioeconomic factors, treatment shortages, and limited access to care or inadequate assessment of the quality of care.

This is a retrospective, nationwide multicenter study of patients with mRCC after diagnosis at 10 different tertiary medical centers in Korea from January 1992 to December 2017. We focused on patients at either \"favorable\" or \"intermediate\" risk according to the International mRCC Database Consortium criteria, and they were followed up (median 335 days). Finally, a total of 1409 patients were selected as the study population. We generated a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for covariates, and the different therapy schemes were statistically tested in terms of OS as well as PFS. In addition, frequencies of discontinuation and adverse events were compared among the therapy schemes. Of the primary patterns of treatment sequences (24 sequences), \"sunitinib-pazopanib\" and \"sunitinib-everolimus-immunotherapy\" showed the most beneficial results in both OS and PFS with significantly lower hazards than \"sunitinib\", which is the most commonly treated agent in Korea. Considering that the \"TKI-TKI\" structure showed relatively higher discontinuation rates with higher adverse effects, the overall beneficial sequence would be \"sunitinib-everolimus-immunotherapy\".

SURECAN is a multi-centre, pragmatic, individual participant randomised controlled trial of an intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy supplemented by support for return to meaningful work and/or physical activity (ACT+). This qualitative study addresses the ways in which participants believe they benefit from ACT+ (or not), and how the ACT+ intervention might best be implemented into routine National Health Service (NHS) care. The study investigates experiences of ACT+ by different participants to understand how we can optimise the ACT+ intervention and its delivery (assuming the intervention is successful). We will conduct individual interviews with participants who have taken part in the active arm of the SURECAN trial to understand their experiences of engaging with and receiving ACT+, their perceptions of the impact of the therapy, and relevant contextual factors influencing these experiences. In particular, we will focus on comparing our interview findings between those trial participants who improved and those who failed to improve (or worsened), in terms of quality of life following ACT+.

        "AbstractText": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of a research study called ALPINE. The study involved people who had been diagnosed with, and previously treated at least once for, relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).Lymphocytes help to find and fight off viruses and infections in the body, but when someone has CLL or SLL, the body creates abnormal lymphocytes, leaving the patient with a weakened immune system and susceptible to illness. In CLL, these lymphocytes are in the bone marrow and bloodstream, whereas for SLL, they are mostly found in the lymph nodes, such as those in the neck.How was the research done? The ALPINE study was designed to directly compare the cancer-fighting effects and side effects of zanubrutinib and ibrutinib as treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL.What were the results? After 30\u00a0months, zanubrutinib was more effective than ibrutinib at reducing and keeping the cancer from coming back. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03734016 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

An understanding of the early molecular processes that lead to ESCC may facilitate opportunities for early diagnosis; however, these remain poorly defined. Tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) is a rare syndrome associated with a high lifetime risk of ESCC and germline mutations in RHBDF2, encoding iRhom2. Using TOC as a model of ESCC predisposition, this study aimed to identify early-stage transcriptional changes in ESCC development. Esophageal biopsies were obtained from control and TOC individuals, the latter undergoing surveillance endoscopy, and adjacent diagnostic biopsies were graded as having no dysplasia or malignancy. Bulk RNA-Seq was performed, and findings were compared with sporadic ESCC vs normal RNA-Seq datasets. Multiple transcriptional changes were identified in TOC samples, relative to controls, and many were detected in ESCC. Accordingly, pathway analyses predicted an enrichment of cancer-associated processes linked to cellular proliferation and metastasis, and several transcription factors were predicted to be associated with TOC and ESCC, including negative enrichment of GRHL2. Subsequently, a filtering strategy revealed 22 genes that were significantly dysregulated in both TOC and ESCC. Moreover, Keratin 17, which was upregulated in TOC and ESCC, was also found to be overexpressed at the protein level in 'normal' TOC esophagus tissue. Transcriptional changes occur in TOC esophagus prior to the onset of dysplasia, many of which are associated with ESCC. These findings support the utility of TOC to help reveal the early molecular processes that lead to sporadic ESCC.",

We conducted a cohort study using the National Cancer Database and included patients diagnosed between 2013 and 2020 with stage IV esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The association of immunotherapy with OS was assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age at diagnosis, race, sex, stage, histology, Charlson score, education, income, insurance, hospital type, place of living, region, distance to facility, year of diagnosis, and treatment modality. Of 18,260 patients, 2946 (17%) received immunotherapy.

One hundred and ten out of 229 (48%) had abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan at lipase elevation; data of 110 without pancreatic metastases were analyzed. We analyzed serial CT-based pancreas volumetry data in 48 patients with AIPI (32 with normal CT and 16 with pancreatitis on CT at lipase elevation). We examined impact of steroids on pain and disease course. In AIPI (n\u00a0= 229), median lipase elevation was 4x upper limit of normal (range: 3-40x). The injury was more often asymptomatic than painful (143/229 (62%) vs 86/229 (38%), P < .000).

The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway presents as one of the most upregulated pathways in HCC. However, it has so far not been targetable in the clinical setting. Therefore, studying new targets of this signaling cascade from a therapeutic aspect could enable reversal, delay, or prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis. Although enormous advancement has been achieved in HCC research and its therapeutic management, since HCC often occurs in the context of other liver diseases such as cirrhosis leading to liver dysfunction and/or impaired drug metabolism, the current therapies face the challenge of safely and effectively delivering drugs to the HCC tumor site. In this review, we discuss how a targeted nano drug delivery system could help minimize the off-target toxicities of conventional HCC therapies as well as enhance treatment efficacy. We also put forward the current challenges in HCC nanomedicine along with some potential therapeutic targets from the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway that could be used for HCC therapy. Overall, this review will provide an insight to the current advances, limitations and how HCC nanomedicine could change the landscape of some of the undruggable targets in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.",

We evaluated 10-year outcomes in the Cooperative Studies Program #380 screening colonoscopy cohort, which includes a biorepository of selected individuals with baseline AN (defined as CRC or adenoma \u226510 mm or villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia) and matched individuals without AN. A PRS was constructed from 136 prespecified CRC-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the PRS for associations with AN prevalence at baseline screening colonoscopy or incident AN in participants with at least one follow-up colonoscopy. The PRS was associated with AN risk at baseline screening colonoscopy (P\u00a0= .004). Participants in the lowest PRS quintile had more than a 70% decreased risk of AN at baseline (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.58; P < .001) compared to participants with a PRS in the middle quintile. Using a PRS cut-off of more than the first quintile to indicate need for colonoscopy as primary screening, the sensitivity for detecting AN at baseline is 91.8%. We did not observe a relationship between the PRS and incident AN during follow-up (P\u00a0= .28). A PRS could identify individuals at low risk for prevalent AN. Ongoing work will determine whether this PRS can identify a subset of individuals at sufficiently low risk who could safely delay or be reassured about noninvasive screening.

Using the National Cancer Database, we analyzed incident HCC cases from 2010 to 2020. The incidence rate was calculated using the population data for each year from the census bureau. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied for trend analysis, and a polynomial regression model estimated the number of projected HCC cases in 2020 according to the trend of rates from 2010 to 2019. The distribution of cancer stage and treatment modality were assessed. The pandemic led to a significant reduction in reported HCC cases, from 19,597 in 2019 to 16,188 in 2020. The projected number of HCC for 2020 was 19,011, corresponding to a 14.8% reduction in 2020. Extent of reduction in the number of incident HCC cases relative to estimated cases remains consistent in racial and ethnic subgroups. Despite underdiagnosis of HCC in 2020, proportion of patients with early tumor stage (30.5% for Tumour, Node, Metastasis stage 1) and curative treatment receipt (9.1% for surgical resection, 13% for ablation, 4.2% for liver transplant) for HCC remained stable in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We performed a retrospective chart review of prospectively accrued children with PHTS at 2 tertiary-care centers. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Chi-squared, and Fisher's exact tests and Firth's logistic regression were utilized to explore associations between variables. This series included 80 children with disease-causing PTEN variants. Common GI manifestations included constipation in 41 (51%), feeding issues in 31 (39%), and polyps in 22 (28%) children. The polyps were of mixed histologic types. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders were observed in 5 (6%) children. Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and protein-losing enteropathy were observed once each. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders were observed exclusively in patients without ASD (P\u00a0= .052).

Recently, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released data from deep sequencing of environmental samples collected from the market after it was closed on 1 January 2020. Prior to this release, Crits-Christoph et\u00a0al. analyzed data from a subset of the samples. Both that study and the Chinese CDC study concurred that the samples contained genetic material from a variety of species, including some like raccoon dogs that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, neither study systematically analyzed the relationship between the amount of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 and different animal species. Here I implement a fully reproducible computational pipeline that jointly analyzes the number of reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 and the mitochondrial genomes of chordate species across the full set of samples. I validate the presence of genetic material from numerous species and calculate mammalian mitochondrial compositions similar to those reported by Crits-Christoph et\u00a0al. However, the SARS-CoV-2 content of the environmental samples is generally very low: only 21 of 176 samples contain more than ten SARS-CoV-2 reads, despite most samples being sequenced to depths exceeding 108 total reads. None of the samples with double-digit numbers of SARS-CoV-2 reads have a substantial fraction of their mitochondrial material from any non-human susceptible species. Only one of the fourteen samples with at least a fifth of the chordate mitochondrial material from raccoon dogs contains any SARS-CoV-2 reads, and that sample only has 1 of ~200,000,000 reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 reads are most correlated with reads mapping to various fish, such as catfish and largemouth bass. These results suggest that while metagenomic analysis of the environmental samples is useful for identifying animals or animal products sold at the market, co-mingling of animal and viral genetic material is unlikely to reliably indicate whether any animals were infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Synthesis of nimbolide and its analogues and their application as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 trapping inducers.",
        "AbstractText": "Nimbolide, a ring seco-C limonoid natural product, was recently found to inhibit the poly(ADP)-ribosylation (PARylation)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF114. In doing so, it induces the 'supertrapping' of both PARylated PARP1 and PAR-dependent DNA-repair factors. PARP1 inhibitors have reshaped the treatment of cancer patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations partly through the PARP1 trapping mechanism. To this end, modular access to nimbolide analogues represents an opportunity to develop cancer therapeutics with enhanced PARP1 trapping capability. Here we report a convergent synthesis of nimbolide through a late-stage coupling strategy. Through a sulfonyl hydrazone-mediated etherification and a radical cyclization, this strategy uses a pharmacophore-containing building block and diversifiable hydrazone units to enable the modular synthesis of nimbolide and its analogues. The broad generality of our synthetic strategy allowed access to a variety of analogues with their preliminary cellular cytotoxicity and PARP1 trapping activity reported.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 are members of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases (NTRK) family, which encode TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors, respectively. Hematologic cancers are also linked to point mutations in the NTRK gene's kinase domain. Trk fusions are the most common genetic change associated with oncogenic activity in Trk-driven liquid tumors. Thus, point mutations in NTRK genes may also play a role in tumorigenesis. The structural and functional effect of mutations in Trk-B & Trk-C proteins remains unclear. Methods: In this research, Homology (threading-based approach) modeling and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations approaches are applied to examine the structural and functional behavior of native and mutant Trk-B and Trk-C proteins at the molecular level. Results: The result of this study reveals how the mutations in Trk-B (A203T & R458G) and Trk-C (E176D & L449F) proteins lost their stability and native conformations. The Trk-B mutant A203T became more flexible than the native protein, whereas the R458G mutation became more rigid than the native conformation of the Trk-B protein. Also, the Trk-C mutations (E176D & L449F) become more rigid compared to the native structure. Conclusions: This structural transition may interrupt the function of Trk-B and Trk-C proteins. Observing the impact of NTRK-2/3 gene alterations at the atomic level could aid in discovering a viable treatment for Trk-related leukemias.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A systematic review of the complications of skin puncturing procedures in the upper limbs of patients that have undergone procedures on the axilla or breast.",
        "AbstractText": "The increasing incidence and prevalence of breast malignancies have led to increasing numbers of surgical interventions performed on the axilla and breast, including axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and mastectomy. The risk of postoperative complications, like breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL), can have significant deleterious cosmetic and quality of life effects. National guidelines and cancer councils publish recommendations to avoid skin puncturing procedures, such as venepuncture and intravenous (IV) cannulation, on arms ipsilateral to the surgical site to prevent BCRL occurrence. The initial trials that established a link between BCRL and skin puncture were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s; the evolution of surgical management of breast cancer has likely led to large decreases in complication rates. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, four databases were systematically searched for relevant articles. Eleven relevant articles were identified for inclusion in the final analysis. Updated Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists & Faculty of Pain Medicine (ANZCA) guidelines were included in the analysis following their publication after the initial search had been completed. The overall quality and quantity of evidence in this field is sufficient to conclude that skin puncturing procedures on ipsilateral arms should not be avoided in patients with previous breast or axillary surgery. The highest-quality and most recent available evidence does not support an association between BCRL and skin puncturing procedures. Policies and practices that advocate avoiding skin puncture procedures to prevent BCRL may lead to delays in clinical care. The 2023 ANZCA guidelines recommend against avoiding affected arms for peripheral access and suggest the removal of institutional policies preventing this practice. In patients that have undergone breast surgery or axillary procedures, venous access procedures can be safely performed on the ipsilateral arm. The evidence does not support overarching restrictions on using the ipsilateral arm without pre-existing lymphoedema.",

        "AbstractText": "There is a growing demand for lung parenchymal-sparing localized therapies due to the rising incidence of multifocal lung cancers and the growing number of patients who cannot undergo surgery. Lung cancer screening has led to the discovery of more pre-malignant or early-stage lung cancers, and the focus has shifted from treatment to prevention. Transbronchial therapy is an important tool in the local treatment of lung cancers, with microwave ablation showing promise based on early and mid-term results. To improve the precision and efficiency of transbronchial ablation, adjuncts such as mobile C-arm platforms, software to correct for computed tomography (CT)-to-body divergence, metal-containing nanoparticles, and robotic bronchoscopy are useful. Other forms of energy such as steam vapor therapy, pulsed electric field, and photodynamic therapy are being intensively investigated. In addition, the future of transbronchial therapies may involve the intratumoral injection of novel agents such as immunomodulating agents, gene therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Extensive pre-clinical and some clinical research has shown the synergistic abscopal effect of combination of these agents with ablation. This article aims to provide the latest updates on these technologies and explore their most likely future applications.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy of highly proliferative lymphoblasts. ALL is the most common cancer in children, and is typically treated with combination chemotherapy. The 5-year survival of ALL improved significantly in recent decades with this treatment approach. However, certain age groups (below 2 and over 10 years of age) have much worse prognosis, and over 50% of patients with ALL experience long-term side effects proportional to the dosage of anticancer drugs. Therefore, different treatment strategies are required to improve survival in ALL and to reduce side effects of chemotherapy. Since epigenetic modifications are dominantly reversible, \"epidrugs\" (drugs targeting epigenetic markers) are considered for feasibility in the treatment of ALL as epigenetic modifications, and acetylation of histones was demonstrated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALL. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to be differentially expressed in several hematological malignancies, including ALL. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been shown to express selective toxicity for ALL cells, but they showed limited efficacy and higher than expected toxicity in mouse models or clinical trials in ALL. The aim of this review is to examine the role of the microbiota and microbial metabolites in the mechanisms of HDAC functions, and explore the utilization of the microbiota and microbial metabolites in improving the efficacy of HDACi in ALL. HDAC regulators and natural HDACi are depleted in ALL due to microbiota change leading to a decrease in butyrate and propionate, and HDACi treatment is not effective in ALL due to their short half-life. We propose that HDACi released by the microbiota may be necessary in HDAC regulation and this process is impaired in ALL. Furthermore, the review will also consider the role of restoration of the microbiota or supplementation of natural HDACi in potentially restoring HDAC and HDACi functions.",

One of the treatment options is the combination of everolimus with exemestane or other endocrine drug in later lines mainly based on progression-free survival (PFS) results of the phase 3 BOLERO-2 trial. Altogether, clinical trials did not prove an overall survival (OS) benefit and considerable side effects hampered its application in the day-by-day practice. In recent years CDK4/6-inhibitors became a first-choice combination partner to the endocrine treatment, everolimus still has a place within the treatment armamentarium. Although everolimus is a targeted drug, there is no accepted predictive biomarker and further patient selection is not possible. However, several directions can be defined how to optimally use everolimus. For update information on everolimus treatment in breast cancer I have performed a literature search. I used the keywords \"breast cancer\" and \"everolimus\" and extended the search in PubMed from 01/01/2014 to 10/02/2023. I considered all phase 3 trials, the phase 1-2 trials with not repetitive information, studies with biomarker results and I also checked review articles to identify potential relevant other clinical trial reports. I also have made a search in clinicaltrials.gov for recently completed and ongoing trials. I summarized the search results in this concise and brief report focusing on main trial results and ongoing research with everolimus. The most promising research directions seem to be further investigations for useable predictive biomarkers, for combinations with other targeted drugs (even in a triple combination) and for the feasibility of pharmacologically guided dosing method.",

        "AbstractText": "Serous endometrial cancers (ECs) are an aggressive histotype of ECs which are disproportionately responsible for 40% of cancer-specific mortality rates despite constituting only 5-10% of all uterine cancers in incidence. In recent times, it has become increasingly evident that about 20-40% of uterine serous cancers (USCs) have molecular alterations in ERBB2 pathway with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) amplification or overexpression. We summarise the evidence on genetic and molecular alterations in HER2/neu pathway in USC with a focus on testing criteria, targeting agents and resistance mechanisms. We conducted a database search of PubMed/Medline up to 28th February 2023 for articles published in the English language using pre-defined search terms. One hundred and seventy-one relevant articles were subsequently reviewed for eligibility and inclusion in the review. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification is a significant development in the molecular profiling of ECs with a positive impact on the treatment of these tumors including USCs. Testing criteria for HER2/neu in USC with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has evolved in more than a decade with progress made towards EC specific testing guidelines. The findings of a recent phase III study have led to the development of practice changing guidelines towards improving patient outcomes. Molecular aberration in the HER2/neu pathway contributes to the aggressive behaviour of USC. Considering the clinical benefit conferred by HER2/neu targeted therapy, HER2/neu testing is recommended for all cases of serous EC in advanced and recurrent settings. Trastuzumab in combination with platinum and taxanes based chemotherapy is the recommended treatment option for patients with advanced or recurrent serous cancers who test positive to HER2/neu. Clinical trials on targeted therapy are ongoing and future research should focus on selection of patients who will derive the most benefit from such therapy.",

Herein, 188 patients (107 male; 81 female) who underwent radical surgery for OSCC were included. We evaluated the risk factors for postoperative CKD after treatment, including demographic, perioperative, and postoperative factors by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were divided into post-operative CKD and control groups based on eGFR evaluation. Overall survival (OS) rates were compared between the groups. eGFR decreased over time after treatment in both patient groups. Postoperative CKD was diagnosed in 56 (29.8%) patients. The average number of contrast-enhanced CT examinations was not an independent risk factor for postoperative CKD. However, lower hemoglobin on hospital discharge [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.53], lower eGFR on hospital discharge (OR\u2009=\u20090.84), and common use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR\u2009=\u200948.79) were significant risk factors associated with postoperative CKD. The control group was associated with a better OS than the postoperative CKD group; however, this difference was not significant. Clinicians should pay close attention to these risk factor of post-operative CKD during the management of patients with OSCC that undergo radical surgery and frequent follow-up CT examinations with contrast media.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted and included patients from 2014 to 2021 who were treated at a tertiary referral center. Twenty patients underwent END and 36 were managed expectantly, with a mean follow-up period of 28\u00a0months. ONM was observed in 26% of the study cohort with 16.7% occurring in the maxilla and 36.4% in the mandible. No specific histopathologic features were predictive for ONM. No regional recurrence occurred. Local recurrence occurred in 5% and 2.8% of END and OBS groups, respectively. Two-year DFS were comparable between the END (93.8%) versus OBS (83.9%) as well as maxilla (90.9%) versus mandible (83.4%), P\u2009>\u20090.05. ONM remains variable in cT1-T2N0 GSCC with a greater incidence occurring in the mandible when compared to the maxilla, respectively. An END should be strongly considered for mandibular GSCC.

A systematic search was carried out in PubMed database for available English literature from last 10 years between 2011 and 2021. Keyword combinations used were 'Oral Metronomic chemotherapy for oral cancer, mechanism of action of OMCT, Oral metronomic chemotherapy in India, OMCT in recurrent and palliative treatment of oral cancers.'

On careful stratification of these studies, we found that OMCT has a lot to offer in palliative settings, recurrent, and metastatic HNSCC. There is some limited evidence of its role in adjuvant therapy as maintenance and in neoadjuvant setting. With current evidence, there is a definite role of OMCT in treatment of oral SCC. OMCT can be an alternative in patients who are not tolerable or affordable for standard palliative chemotherapy and also an option for patient who are waiting for surgery.

The signaling pathway involving p53/RCC2/Rac1 has been proposed to contribute to the regulation of colon cancer metastasis. However, until now, this pathway has not been thoroughly investigated in breast cancer. This study seeks to explore the influence of immunohistochemical expression and the correlation among RCC2, Rac1, and p53 in breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). Immunostaining was performed on 120 breast IDC specimens using RCC2, Rac1, and p53 antibodies. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the correlations between these antibodies. A Positive expression of RCC2, Rac1, and p53 was observed in 116 (96.7%), 120 (100%), and 33 (27.5%) of the breast cancer cases, respectively. RCC2, Rac1, and p53 demonstrated association with poor prognostic parameters such as frequent mitoses, high Ki-67 status, positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and advanced tumor stage. A highly significant direct correlation was found between each immunohistochemical marker and the other two markers. Shorter overall survival was linked to multifocal tumors (P=0.017), advanced tumor stage (T3) (P=0.010), Luminal B subtype (P=0.015), progressive disease (P=0.003), positive Her2neu status (P=0.008), and metastasis to distant organs (P<0.001). However, RCC2, Rac1, and p53 did not exhibit a significant association with overall survival. The high expression levels of RCC2, Rac1, and p53 in breast IDC suggest their potential role in tumor behavior. The association of RCC2 and Rac1 with poor prognostic parameters may serve as predictive indicators for aggressive tumors, thus implying that targeted therapy could be beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer.",

Among them, 93.3% of patients were classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C, 52.0% had portal vein tumour thrombosis (PVTT), and 60.7% extrahepatic spread. Patients were classified as follows: group 1 (n = 84) had no irAEs, group 2 (n = 37) had mild irAEs (grade 1-2), and group 3 (n = 29) had severe irAEs (grade \u22653). The median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) were 13.6, 5.7, and 3.6 months, respectively. Group 2 demonstrated significantly superior OS compared to group 1 (9.5 months) and group 3 (5.6 months), with a median OS of 23.0 months (p < 0.001). Furthermore, group 2 demonstrated significantly better outcomes in terms of PFS and TTD compared to both group 1 and group 3 (p < 0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis identified mild irAEs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.353; p = 0.010), ALBI grade 1 (HR, 0.389; p = 0.006), Child-Pugh class A (HR, 0.338; p = 0.002), and the absence of PVTT (HR, 0.556; p = 0.043) as independent predictors of better OS. Our study highlights the significant impact of irAE severity on the outcomes of patients with HCC receiving A + B. Notably, the occurrence of mild irAEs was independently associated with favourable survival, suggesting their potential role as surrogate indicators of HCC prognosis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Initial Journey of Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (PaCTO Project): A Nationwide Survey among Portuguese Specialist Physicians.",
        "AbstractText": "We aimed to characterize the initial healthcare journey of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients in Portugal, including healthcare provision and factors affecting therapeutic decisions, namely BRCA mutations testing. This is a descriptive cross-sectional, web-based survey using a convenience sampling approach. Portuguese oncologists and pathologists that routinely work with mPDAC patients from the different geographical regions and settings were invited to participate in the study via email (December 2020). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed, with categorical variables reported as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables with non-normal distribution as median and interquartile range (IQR) (Stata v.15.0). Seventy physicians participated in the study (43 oncologists, 27 pathologists). According to the responses, a median of 28 patients per center (IQR 12-70) was diagnosed with PDAC in the previous year; 22 of them referring (IQR 8-70) to mPDAC. The pointed median time from patients' first hospital admission until disease diagnosis/staging is between 2 and 4 weeks. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle biopsy is available in most hospitals (86%). Around 50% of physicians request BRCA testing; the assessment of additional biomarkers besides BRCA is requested by 40% of professionals. Half of them stated that BRCA testing should be requested earlier-upon histological diagnosis, especially because the median time for results is of 4.0 weeks (IQR 4-8). PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, when available, would be the therapy of choice for most oncologists (71%) if no disease' progression occurs after 4 months. Treatments' selection is usually grounded on clinical criteria (e.g., performance status, liver function). Around 45% of patients use FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX as the first-line therapy. Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel is used by 35% of patients as the second-line therapy. Physicians in Portugal support the increasing role of patient-tailored treatments in mPDAC, whose selection should be grounded on tumoral subtyping and molecular profiling. Further efforts to develop multidisciplinary teams, standardized clinical practice, and optimize the implementation of new target therapies are needed. Este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar o percurso inicial dos doentes com adenocarcinoma ductal pancre\u00e1tico metast\u00e1tico (ACDPm) em Portugal, incluindo a presta\u00e7\u00e3o de cuidados de sa\u00fade e determina\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores que afetam as decis\u00f5es terap\u00eauticas, nomeadamente o teste de muta\u00e7\u00f5es BRCA.

De acordo com as respostas, uma mediana de 28 doentes por centro (IIQ 12\u201370) foi diagnosticada com ACDP no ano anterior; 22 deles (IIQ 8\u201370) referentes a ACDPm. O tempo m\u00e9dio desde a primeira admiss\u00e3o hospitalar dos doentes at\u00e9 o diagn\u00f3stico/estadiamento da doen\u00e7a foi entre 2\u20134 semanas. A ultrassonografia endosc\u00f3pica com bi\u00f3psia por agulha fina \u00e9 realizada pela maioria dos hospitais (86%). Aproximadamente 50% dos m\u00e9dicos referem solicitar o teste BRCA; a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de biomarcadores adicionais al\u00e9m do BRCA \u00e9 solicitada por 40% dos profissionais. Metade dos m\u00e9dicos assume que o teste BRCA deveria ser solicitado mais precocemente \u2013 durante o diagn\u00f3stico histol\u00f3gico, principalmente porque o tempo m\u00e9dio para obten\u00e7\u00e3o do resultado \u00e9 de 4,0 semanas (IIQ 4\u20138). Os inibidores PARP, como o olaparibe, quando dispon\u00edveis, seriam a terapia de escolha para a maioria dos oncologistas (71%) caso n\u00e3o haja progress\u00e3o da doen\u00e7a ap\u00f3s quatro meses.

To eliminate the damage to healthy tissue, it is now possible to inject biocompatible hydrogels between cancerous targets and surrounding tissues to create a spacer pocket. Conventional methods have limitations in poor target visualization and device tracking. In this paper, we leverage our MR-tracking technique to develop a novel injection needle for hydrogel spacer deployment. Herein, we present the working principle and fabrication method, followed by benchtop validation in an agar phantom, and MRI-guided validation in tissue-mimic prostate phantom and sexually mature female swine. Animal trials indicated that the spacer pockets in the rectovaginal septum can be accurately visualized on T2-weighted MRI. The experimental results showed that the vaginal-rectal spacing was successfully increased by 12 \u00b1 2 mm anterior-posterior.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Extracellular vesicles in anti-tumor drug resistance: Mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.",
        "AbstractText": "Drug resistance presents a significant challenge to achieving positive clinical outcomes in anti-tumor therapy. Prior research has illuminated reasons behind drug resistance, including increased drug efflux, alterations in drug targets, and abnormal activation of oncogenic pathways. However, there's a need for deeper investigation into the impact of drug-resistant cells on parental tumor cells and intricate crosstalk between tumor cells and the malignant tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs) have provided valuable insights. EVs are membrane-bound particles secreted by all cells, mediating cell-to-cell communication. They contain functional cargoes like DNA, RNA, lipids, proteins, and metabolites from mother cells, delivered to other cells. Notably, EVs are increasingly recognized as regulators in the resistance to anti-cancer drugs. This review aims to summarize the mechanisms of EV-mediated anti-tumor drug resistance, covering therapeutic approaches like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and even radiotherapy. Detecting EV-based biomarkers to predict drug resistance assists in bypassing anti-tumor drug resistance. Additionally, targeted inhibition of EV biogenesis and secretion emerges as a promising approach to counter drug resistance. We highlight the importance of conducting in-depth mechanistic research on EVs, their cargoes, and functional approaches specifically focusing on EV subpopulations. These efforts will significantly advance the development of strategies to overcome drug resistance in anti-tumor therapy.",

The paradigm of one-size-fits-all medicine has already given way to the stratification of patients by disease subtypes, clinical characteristics, and biomarkers (stratified medicine). The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical oncology has made it possible to tailor cancer patient therapy to their molecular profiles. NGS is expected to lead the transition to precision medicine (PM), where the right therapeutic approach is chosen for each patient based on their characteristics and mutations. Here, we highlight how the NGS technology facilitates cancer treatment. In this regard, first, precision medicine and NGS technology are reviewed, and then, the NGS revolution in precision medicine is described. In the sequel, the role of NGS in oncology and the existing limitations are discussed. The available databases and bioinformatics tools and online servers used in NGS data analysis are also reviewed.

        "ArticleTitle": "Integrating rapamycin with novel PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor microRNAs on NOTCH1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).",
        "AbstractText": "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a significant role in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Rapamycin is a potential therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies due to its ability to suppress mTOR activity. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in T-ALL pathophysiology and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of rapamycin and miRNAs in inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in T-ALL cells. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to find miRNAs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Twenty-five bone marrow samples were collected from T-ALL patients, alongside five control bone marrow samples from non-leukemia patients. The Jurkat cell line was chosen as a representative model for T-ALL. Gene and miRNA expression levels were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Two miRNAs exhibiting down-regulation in both clinical samples and Jurkat cells were transfected to the Jurkat cell line to investigate their impact on target gene expression. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential of combination therapy involving miRNAs and rapamycin, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were carried out. Six miRNAs (miR-3143, miR-3182, miR-99a/100, miR-155, miR-576-5p, and miR-501- 3p) were predicted as inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The expression analysis of both clinical samples and the Jurkat cell line revealed a simultaneous downregulation of miR-3143 and miR-3182. Transfection investigation demonstrated that the exogenous overexpression of miR-3143 and miR-3182 can effectively inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the Jurkat cell line. Moreover, when used as a dual inhibitor along with rapamycin, miR-3143 and miR-3182 significantly increased apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in the Jurkat cell line. These preliminary results highlight the potential for improving T-ALL treatment through multi-targeted therapeutic strategies involving rapamycin and miR-3143/miR-3182.",

        "AbstractText": "High metastasis, resistance to common treatments, and high mortality rate, has made triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to be the most invasive type of breast cancer. High telomerase activity and mitochondrial biogenesis are involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis. The catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), plays a role in telomere lengthening and extra-biological functions such as gene expression, mitochondria function, and apoptosis. In this study, it has been aimed to evaluate intrinsic-, extrinsic-apoptosis and DNMT3a and TET2 expression following the inhibition of telomerase and mitochondria respiration in TNBC cell lines. TNBC cells were treated with IC50 levels of BIBR1532, tigecycline, and also their combination. Then, telomere length, and DNMT3a, TET2, and hTERT expression were evaluated. Finally, apoptosis rate, apoptosis-related proteins, and genes were analyzed. The present results showed that IC50 level of telomerase and inhibition of mitochondria respiration induced apoptosis but did not leave any significant effect on telomere length. The results also indicated that telomerase inhibition induced extrinsic-apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and caused intrinsic- apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, it was found that the expression of p53 decreased and was ineffective in cell apoptosis. The expressions of DNMT3a and TET2 increased in cells. In addition, combination treatment was better than BIBR1532 and tigecycline alone. The inhibition of telomerase and mitochondria respiration caused intrinsic- and extrinsic- apoptosis and increased DNMT3a and TET2 expression and it could be utilized in breast cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Pyridopyrimidines belong to a class of compounds characterized by the presence of nitrogen as heteroatoms. These compounds exhibit diverse biological effects, particularly showing promise as anticancer agents, including actions that inhibit CDK4/6. We designed and synthesized a range of substituted thiazolo-pyridopyrimidines (4a-p). Computational ADME/T analysis and molecular docking were performed using the crystal structure of CDK4/6. Subsequently, we synthesized the top-scoring compounds, characterized them using IR, NMR, and Mass spectroscopy, and assessed their impact on MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines using the SRB assay. To further evaluate stability, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for the two most promising compounds within the binding site. The docking scores indicated stronger interactions for compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, and 4g. As a result, these specific compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, and 4g) were chosen for synthesis and subsequent screening to assess their cytotoxic effects. Remarkably, compounds 4c and 4a exhibited the most promising activity in terms of their IC50 values across both tested cell lines. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation studies uncovered an elevated level of stability within the 4c-6OQO complex. By integrating insights from computational, in vitro, and molecular dynamics simulation findings, compound 4c emerges as a leading candidate for future investigations. The presence of a polar hydroxyl group at the C2 position of the 8-phenyl substitution on the pyridopyrimidine rings appears to contribute to the heightened activity of the compound. Further enhancements to cytotoxic potential could be achieved through structural refinements.",

        "AbstractText": "The rapid increase in the worldwide prevalence of obesity and certain non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as: cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, has been mainly attributed to an excess of sugar consumption. Although the potential benefits of the synergetic use of sweeteners have been known for many years, recent development based on synthesis strategies to produce sucrose-like taste profiles is emerging where biocatalyst approaches may be preferred to produce and supply specific sweetener compounds. From a nutritional standpoint, high-intensity sweeteners have fewer calories than sugars while providing a major sweet potency, placing them in the spotlight as valuable alternatives to sugar. Due to the modern world awareness and incidence of metabolic diseases, both food research and growing markets have focused on two generally regarded as safe (GRAS) groups of compounds: the sweet diterpenoid glycosides present on the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana and, more recently, on the cucurbitane triterpene glycosides present on the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii. In spite of their flavor advantages, biological benefits, including: antidiabetic, anticancer, and cardiovascular properties, have been elucidated. The present bibliographical review dips into the state-of-the-art of sweeteners and their role in human health as sugar replacements, as well as the biotransformation methods for steviol gylcosides and mogrosides apropos of enzymatic technology to update and locate the discoveries to date in the scientific literature to help boost the continuity of research efforts of the ongoing sweeteners.",

Robust evidence to guide treatment is lacking and knowledge on targeted therapies and immunotherapy is mainly based on adult studies. Currently, the International Society of Pediatric Oncology-Renal Tumor Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) 2016 UMBRELLA protocol recommends sunitinib for metastatic or unresectable RCC. This retrospective study describes the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-(L)1) monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapeutic regimens in advanced-stage and relapsed pediatric RCC. Of the 31 identified patients (0-18\u2009years) with histologically proven RCC, 3/31 presented with TNM stage I/II, 8/31 with TNM stage III, and 20/31 with TNM stage IV at diagnosis. The majority were diagnosed with translocation type RCC (MiT-RCC) (21/31) and the remaining patients mainly presented with papillary or clear-cell RCC. Treatment in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, or upon relapse or progression, included mono- or combination therapy with a large variety of drugs, illustrating center specific choices in most patients. Sunitinib was often administered as first choice and predominantly resulted in stable disease (53%). Other frequently used drugs included axitinib, cabozantinib, sorafenib, and nivolumab; however, no treatment seemed more promising than sunitinib. Overall, 15/31 patients died of disease, 12/31 are alive with active disease, and only four patients had a complete response. The sample size and heterogeneity of this cohort only allowed descriptive statistical analysis. This study provides an overview of a unique series of clinical and treatment characteristics of pediatric patients with RCC treated with targeted therapies.",

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the available literature on the effects of BR on postoperative psychological distress. A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, PSYCinfo, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria included clinical studies of patients who underwent BR post-mastectomy with psychological distress assessments as primary outcomes. Articles were independently reviewed and assessed for bias and evidence quality. Analyses were performed among patients receiving mastectomy alone (MA) versus mastectomy with breast reconstruction (MBR), immediate versus delayed mastectomy, and implant-based versus autologous reconstruction. Ninety-nine studies published from 1980-2021 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Twenty-six (26.3%) studies compared patients who underwent MBR to those who underwent MA. Of these, 18 (69.2%) found that MBR had superior effects on psychologic outcomes, 6 (23.1%) found no differences, and 2 (7.7%) found negative psychologic effects relative to MA. Fourteen (14.1%) studies compared immediate versus delayed BR, of which 4 (28.6%) found that immediate BR had superior psychologic outcomes while 10 (71.4%) found no significant differences. Sixteen (16.2%) studies compared autologous versus implant-based reconstruction. Eight (50.0%) of these reported patients with autologous BR were more satisfied with breast appearance. While findings are not uniform, the majority of studies found that BR following mastectomy improves psychologic outcomes, with a possible benefit of immediate over delayed BR.

        "AbstractText": "Phase IV clinical trials are designed to monitor long-term side effects of medical treatment. For instance, childhood cancer survivors treated with chest radiation and/or anthracycline are often at risk of developing cardiotoxicity during their adulthood. Often the primary focus of a study could be on estimating the cumulative incidence of a particular outcome of interest such as cardiotoxicity. However, it is challenging to evaluate patients continuously and usually, this information is collected through cross-sectional surveys by following patients longitudinally. This leads to interval-censored data since the exact time of the onset of the toxicity is unknown. Rai et al. computed the transition intensity rate using a parametric model and estimated parameters using maximum likelihood approach in an illness-death model. However, such approach may not be suitable if the underlying parametric assumptions do not hold. This manuscript proposes a semi-parametric model, with a logit relationship for the treatment intensities in two groups, to estimate the transition intensity rates within the context of an illness-death model. The estimation of the parameters is done using an EM algorithm with profile likelihood. Results from the simulation studies suggest that the proposed approach is easy to implement and yields comparable results to the parametric model.",

Besides the high nutritional value, countless evidences show that incorporating nuts into the diet may contribute to health promotion and prevention of certain diseases.

        "AbstractText": "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare malignant tumor with a dismal prognosis, with isolated case reports in Chile. The BPDCN can present skin and bone marrow compromise, and its diagnosis is frequently confused with other pathologies. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and immunophenotypical features of BPDCN in the Chilean population. We performed a retrospective study from 2013 to 2021 in clinical records of 2 public Chilean referral hospitals, including ten patients, 80% male, with a median age of 66 years (15-81). The most frequent initial referral diagnoses were T-cell lymphoma (4/10) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (3/10). Seven patients presented skin and bone marrow involvement; we found a lower frequency of adenopathies (5/10), splenomegaly (2/10), and hepatomegaly (2/10). The complete blood count revealed anemia and leukopenia, with blasts in 5/10. Nine patients received induction therapy. CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was indicated in 8/10 cases with remission in 5/8, and 1 patient received HyerCVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone, methotrexate, cytarabine) and an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. The median survival was 10 months (95% CI 4.2-15.8 months) with 9/10 deaths. Relapse in the central nervous system was documented in 2 cases. Our study found that BPDCN, a rare pathology in the Chilean population, shows a similar clinical presentation compared to previous studies. It is susceptible to respond to initial systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy.",

However, the CRF in the Chilean population diagnosed with cancer is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the association that the CRF had between people with and without a cancer diagnosis and, secondarily, to compare the trend of the CRF according to years of cancer diagnosis in the Chilean population. Data from 5,483 people from the 2016-2017 National Health Survey between 15 and 98 years old were analyzed. Cancer diagnosis (all available) was determined with standardized questions, and CRF was calculated with an abbreviated method (demographics, anthropometry, lifestyles). Linear regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables was performed with the complex sample analysis module of the STATA v.16 program (95% CI, p < 0.05). People with some cancer diagnosis versus those without cancer had a lower FCR level (ft: -1.23 [95% CI: -1.52; -0.94]). When comparing CRF levels according to cancer type, similar results were observed for colorectal, breast, and uterine cancer (p < 0.001) but not for thyroid cancer (p = 0.253). There was lower CRF from the first year of diagnosis of all types of cancer to over ten years, although not significant (p = 0.109). Those diagnosed with cancer presented lower CRF compared to those not diagnosed. In addition, in people with cancer, the CRF decreased with increasing years since the first diagnosis. It would be essential to evaluate and increase CRF in cancer patients.",

The current guidelines recommends that diagnosis requires the finding of intestinal metaplasia (IM) with goblet cells of at least 1 cm in length. BE affects approximately 1% of the general population and up to 14% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). BE is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which has increased in western countries. The main risk factors described for EAC associated with BE are male sex, age > 50 years, central obesity and tobacco use. Annual risk of EAC in patients with BE without dysplasia, low grade (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia is 0,1-0,3%, 0,5% y 5-8%, respectively. Treatment of non-dysplastic BE consists mainly of a healthy lifestyle change, chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors and surveillance endoscopy every 3 to 5 years. It is recommended that from the presence of LGD patients are referred to an expert center for confirmation of the diagnosis, stage and thus define their management. In patients with BE and dysplasia or early-stage cancer, endoscopic therapy with resection and ablation is successful in about 90% of the patients. The main adverse event is esophageal stricture, which is managed endoscopically.",

In this study we created disease estimates using national EHR for three high burden conditions, compared estimates between linked and unlinked datasets and produced stratified estimates by age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and geographical region. EHRs containing primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink), secondary care (Hospital Episode Statistics) and mortality records (Office for National Statistics) were used. We used existing disease phenotyping algorithms to identify cases of cancer (breast, lung, colorectal and prostate), type 1 and 2 diabetes, and lower back pain. We calculated age-standardised incidence of first cancer, point prevalence for diabetes, and primary care consultation prevalence for low back pain. 7.2 million people contributing 45.3 million person-years of active follow-up between 2000-2014 were included. CPRD-HES combined and CPRD-HES-ONS combined lung and bowel cancer incidence estimates by sex were similar to cancer registry estimates. Linked CPRD-HES estimates for combined Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were consistently higher than those of CPRD alone, with the difference steadily increasing over time from 0.26% (2.99% for CPRD-HES vs. 2.73 for CPRD) in 2002 to 0.58% (6.17% vs. 5.59) in 2013. Low back pain prevalence was highest in the most deprived quintile and when compared to the least deprived quintile the difference in prevalence increased over time between 2000 and 2013, with the largest difference of 27% (558.70 per 10,000 people vs 438.20) in 2013. We use national EHRs to produce estimates of burden of disease to produce detailed estimates by deprivation, ethnicity and geographical region. National EHRs have the potential to improve disease burden estimates at a local and global level and may serve as more automated, timely and precise inputs for policy making and global burden of disease estimation.",

        "AbstractText": "Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is an ultra-rare cancer that makes up less than 3% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It most often arises in the soft tissues of the proximal limbs and has a higher incidence in males. Though EMC has a good prognosis, it has an indolent course with high rates of local recurrence as well as metastasis to the lungs. EMC is characterized in 70% of cases by an EWS1-NR4A3 translocation, leading to constitutive expression of NR4A3. Structural variants (SVs) in EMC, especially large-scale genomic alterations, have not been well studied and studies are severely limited by sample size. In this study, we describe Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of a rare case of matched EMC primary tumor, lung metastasis, and pelvic metastasis to identify genomic alterations. We examined somatic variants, copy number variants (CNVs), and larger scale SVs such as translocations and breakend points. While the primary tumor and lung metastasis had similar somatic variations and CNVs, the pelvic metastasis had more unique SVs with especially increased mutational burden of SVs in chromosome 2. This suggests that different molecular drivers appear in more advanced, relapsing EMC compared with the primary tumor and early lung metastasis. Genomic studies such as ours may identify novel molecular complexities in rare cancers that may be leveraged for therapeutic strategies and precision medicine.",

CAR-T cell therapy was approved in 2018 as the first Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) for treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. ATMPs are cell- and gene-based therapies that show great promise for treating various cancers and hereditary diseases. While some new ATMPs have been approved, ongoing clinical trials are expected to lead to the approval of many more. However, the production of CAR-T cells presents a significant challenge due to the high costs associated with the manufacturing process, making the therapy very expensive (approx. $400,000). Furthermore, autologous CAR-T therapy is limited to a make-to-order approach, which makes scaling economical production difficult. First attempts are being made to automate this multi-step manufacturing process, which will not only directly reduce the high manufacturing costs but will also enable comprehensive data collection. AI technologies have the ability to analyze this data and convert it into knowledge and insights. In order to exploit these opportunities, this paper analyses the data potential in the automated CAR-T production process and creates a mapping to the capabilities of AI applications. The paper explores the possible use of AI in analyzing the data generated during the automated process and its capabilities to further improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of CAR-T cell production.",

        "AbstractText": "Approximately 30% of patients experience postoperative complications after surgery for early-stage lung cancer. However, the relationships among meridian energy during lung cancer surgery, changes in quality of life, and prognosis have not been investigated. This study was designed to explore the associations among meridian energy, changes in quality of life, and prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer undergoing surgery. A longitudinal, repeated-measures design was used. Basic data forms, meridian energy measurements, and a concise 12-item health status questionnaire were administered to the participants at the time of diagnosis, 2 weeks post-surgery, and 12 weeks post-surgery. During this period, changes were analyzed, and their association with postoperative risks was explored. Forty-eight cases were investigated. Both meridian energy and quality of life were found to be significantly decreased 2 weeks after surgery. The high/low ratio of meridian energy, the physical component score of the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey Questionnaire, gender, cancer stage, and body mass index were identified as significantly associated with prognosis. Conclusion/Implications for Practice: The declining trends in meridian energy and quality of life during the 2 weeks after surgery in patients with lung cancer are associated with poor postoperative prognoses. Nurses may use the findings of this study to identify patients at high risk of postoperative complications and develop appropriate strategies to provide comprehensive care. \u521d\u8a3a\u65b7\u80ba\u764c\u75c5\u4eba\u63a5\u53d7\u624b\u8853\u671f\u9593\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u54c1\u8cea\u8b8a\u5316\u8207\u9810\u5f8c\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u2014\u7e31\u8cab\u6027\u7814\u7a76. \u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u4e3b\u8981\u6cbb\u7642\u65b9\u5f0f\u70ba\u624b\u8853\uff0c\u7d04\u670930 %\u7684\u75c5\u4eba\u51fa\u73fe\u8853\u5f8c\u4f75\u767c\u75c7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u5c11\u80ba\u764c\u624b\u8853\u671f\u9593\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u8207\u751f\u6d3b\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u9810\u5f8c\u4e4b\u95dc\u806f\u3002. \u63a2\u8a0e\u521d\u8a3a\u65b7\u80ba\u764c\u75c5\u4eba\u624b\u8853\u671f\u9593\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u8207\u9810\u5f8c\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u3002. \u63a1\u7e31\u8cab\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u8907\u6e2c\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u5c0d\u521d\u8a3a\u65b7\u80ba\u764c\u75c5\u4eba\u9032\u884c\u8853\u524d\u3001\u8853\u5f8c2\u9031\u53ca12\u9031\u7684\u6e2c\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u70ba\u57fa\u672c\u8cc7\u6599\u8868\u3001\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u7c21\u660e12\u9805\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u8abf\u67e5\u554f\u5377\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8b8a\u5316\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u8853\u5f8c\u9810\u5f8c\u98a8\u96aa\u95dc\u806f\u3002. \u6536\u930448\u4f4d\u75c5\u4eba\uff0c\u8853\u5f8c2\u9031\u7684\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u54c1\u8cea\u986f\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u6bd4\u503c\u3001\u7c21\u660e12\u9805\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u8abf\u67e5\u554f\u5377\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5c64\u9762\u3001\u6027\u5225\u3001\u764c\u75c7\u5206\u671f\u3001\u8eab\u9ad4\u8cea\u91cf\u6307\u6578\u5206\u5225\u8207\u9810\u5f8c\u5448\u73fe\u986f\u8457\u76f8\u95dc\u3002. \u80ba\u764c\u75c5\u4eba\u8853\u5f8c2\u9031\u7684\u7d93\u7d61\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u54c1\u8cea\u5177\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u8da8\u52e2\uff0c\u4e14\u8207\u4e0d\u826f\u9810\u5f8c\u6709\u95dc\u3002\u8b77\u7406\u4eba\u54e1\u53ef\u4f9d\u64da\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8fa8\u8b58\u9ad8\u98a8\u96aa\u8853\u5f8c\u4e0d\u826f\u9810\u5f8c\u75c5\u4eba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u8b77\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7167\u8b77\u3002.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a devastating complication of cancer that can significantly impact a patient's health and life. The incidence of CAT is approximately 20%, and 1 in 5 cancer patients will develop CAT annually. Indeed, CAT can promote pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, leading to increased morbidity and mortality that dramatically impact survival. CAT can also provoke delay or discontinuation of anticancer treatment, which may result in a lack of treatment efficacy and high costs for patients, institutions, and society. Current guidelines advocate direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as the first-line anticoagulant option in CAT. Compared to low-molecular-weight-heparins (LMWHs), DOACs are advantageous in that they typically have an oral route of administration, do not require laboratory monitoring, and have a more predictable anticoagulant effect. However, in patients with thrombocytopenia, renal failure, or those receiving anticancer regimens with potential for drug-drug interactions, LMWH is still the mainstay of care. The main limitation of current anticoagulant agents is related to bleeding risk (BR), both for DOACs and LMWHs. Specifically, DOACs have been associated with high BR in gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers. In this challenging scenario, abelacimab, an anti-factor XI agent, could represent a viable option in the management of CAT due to its \"hemostasis sparing\" effect. The safe profile of abelacimab could be useful in patients with active malignancy and CAT, as long-term anticoagulant therapy is often required. Two ongoing international phase III trials (Aster and Magnolia) compare abelacimab with the standard of care (i.e., apixaban in patients with CAT and dalteparin in those with CAT and high BR, respectively). Abelacimab is a new and attractive anticoagulant for the management of CAT, especially in the insidious and critical scenario of active cancer patients with venous thromboembolism and high BR. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the updated evidence on the performance of DOACs and LMWHs in the treatment of CAT and to focus on the potential role of abelacimab in CAT and its promising associated clinical trials.",

        "AbstractText": "A growing body of evidence on a wide spectrum of adverse cardiac events following oncologic therapies has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology as an increasingly relevant interdisciplinary specialty. This also calls for better risk-stratification for patients undergoing cancer treatment. Machine learning (ML), a popular branch discipline of artificial intelligence that tackles complex big data problems by identifying interaction patterns among variables, has seen increasing usage in cardio-oncology studies for risk stratification. The objective of this comprehensive review is to outline the application of ML approaches in cardio-oncology, including deep learning, artificial neural networks, random forest and summarize the cardiotoxicity identified by ML. The current literature shows that ML has been applied for the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of cardiotoxicity in cancer patients. In addition, role of ML in gender and racial disparities for cardiac outcomes and potential future directions of cardio-oncology are discussed. It is essential to establish dedicated multidisciplinary teams in the hospital and educate medical professionals to become familiar and proficient in ML in the future.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Serum Globulin to Albumin Ratio as a Novel Predictor of Adverse Clinical Outcomes in Coronary Artery Disease Patients Who Underwent PCI.",
        "AbstractText": "Coronary heart disease is one of the main causes of Mortality. Many biological indicators have been used to predict the prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease. The ratio of serum globulin to albumin (GAR) has been used to predict the prognosis of patients with various cancers. It has been proven that GAR is related to the prognosis of patients with stroke. However, GAR's role in cardiovascular disease remains unclear. Our purpose was to investigate the predictive value of GAR on clinical outcomes in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). From Dec. 2016 to Oct. 2021, a total of 14,994 patients undergoing PCI patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were divided into high GAR group (GAR \u2265 0.76, n = 4087) and low GAR group (GAR < 0.76, n = 10,907). The incidence of adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular mortality (CM), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was compared between the two groups. Multivariate Cox regression was used to adjust for the effects of confounding factors, while hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Median follow-up time was 24 months. Compared with the low GAR group, the high GAR group had significantly higher incidence of ACM (6.5% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001); CM (4.9% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001), MACE (10.5% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), and MACCE (11.3% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed the patients in the high GAR group had a 1.62-fold increased risk for ACM (HR = 2.622, 95% CI: 2.130-3.228, p < 0.01), a 1.782-fold increased risk for CM (HR = 2.782, 95% CI: 2.180-3.550, p < 0.01). There was a 37.2% increased risk for MACE (HR = 1.372, 95% CI: 1.204-1.564, p < 0.01), and 32.4% increased risk for MACCE (HR = 1.324, 95% CI: 1.169-1.500, p < 0.01), compared to the patients in the low GAR group. The present study suggested that post-PCI CAD patients with higher GAR presented significantly increased mortality and adverse events GAR level at admission may 296 be considered as part of risk stratification when PCI is possible in patients with coronary heart disease.

        "ArticleTitle": "Studying the Influence of Finite Element Mesh Size on the Accuracy of Ventricular Tachycardia Simulation.",
        "AbstractText": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening heart condition commonly seen in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Although personalized computational modeling has been used to understand VT and its treatment noninvasively, this approach can be computationally intensive and time consuming. Therefore, finding a balance between mesh size and computational efficiency is important. This study aimed to find an optimal mesh resolution that minimizes the need for computational resources while maintaining numerical accuracy and to investigate the effect of mesh resolution variation on the simulation results. We constructed ventricular models from contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data from six patients with MI. We created seven different models for each patient, with average edge lengths ranging from 315 to 645 \u00b5m using commercial software, Mimics. Programmed electrical stimulation was used to assess VT inducibility from 19 sites in each heart model. The simulation results in the slab model with adaptive tetrahedral mesh (same as in the patient-specific model) showed that the absolute and relative differences in conduction velocity (CV) were 6.1 cm/s and 7.8% between average mesh sizes of 142 and 600 \u00b5m, respectively. However, the simulation results in the six patient-specific models showed that average mesh sizes with 350 \u00b5m yielded over 85% accuracy for clinically relevant VT. Although average mesh sizes of 417 and 478 \u00b5m could also achieve approximately 80% accuracy for clinically relevant VT, the percentage of incorrectly predicted VTs increases. When conductivity was modified to match the CV in the model with the finest mesh size, the overall ratio of positively predicted VT increased. The proposed personalized heart model could achieve an optimal balance between simulation time and VT prediction accuracy when discretized with adaptive tetrahedral meshes with an average edge length about 350 \u00b5m.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is one of the major cause of death globally. Crizotinib is a first-line drug used in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its cardiotoxicity are unknown. This study investigated the mechanisms of crizotinib-induced cardiotoxicity and explored whether this toxicity can be prevented by the angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, crizotinib (40 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   for four weeks), and crizotinib + sacubitril/valsartan (40 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   /60 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   for four weeks). Expression of genes in myocardial tissue were detected by transcriptomic sequencing, with verification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Blood pressure (BP) and cardiac function of animals were measured using non-invasive monitoring and echocardiography approaches. Ventricular refractory period (RP), as well as the induction rate and score of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) were detected by in vivo electrophysiology. Epicardial conductance was measured by mapping. Expression of Myh7 in myocardium was detected by western blot and RT-PCR. DEGs detected using transcriptomic sequencing included 10 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes. The first 5 DEGs identified were Myh7, Ngp, Lcn2, Ciart and Ptgds. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) result indicated that Myh7 is involved in myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac muscle contraction. Crizotinib treatment increased blood pressure, prolonged QTc interval, shortened ventricular RP, increased the incidence and score of right VAs, and increased Myh7 expression. Most of these responses were limited by sacubitril/valsartan. Crizotinib induced a range of cardiotoxic side effects in a mouse model and increased Myh7 expression represents a biomarker for this response. These cardiovascular toxic responses can be largely prevented by sacubitril/valsartan.",

Artificial intelligence software using deep learning algorithms was applied to determine their likelihood of malignancy: most likely benign (AI score < 50%), undetermined (AI score 50-75%) or probably malignant (AI score > 75%). Predictions were compared to two-year follow-up and Brock's model. Ninety incidental pulmonary nodules in 83 patients were retrospectively included. 36 nodules were benign, 13 were malignant and 41 remained indeterminate at 2 years follow-up.AI analysis was possible for 81/90 nodules. The 34 benign nodules had an AI score between 0.02% and 96.73% (mean\u00a0=\u00a048.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.32), while the 11 malignant nodules had an AI score between 82.89% and 100% (mean\u00a0=\u00a093.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3).

Anthracyclines are extremely cardiotoxic, which limits the use of these powerful chemotherapeutic agents. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines, the precise mechanisms by which doxorubicin causes cardiomyocyte death and myocardial dysfunction remain incompletely understood. This review highlights recent updates in mechanisms and therapies involved in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte death, including autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and apoptosis, as well as mechanisms of cardiovascular dysfunction resulting in myocardial atrophy, defects in calcium handling, thrombosis, and cell senescence.

        "AbstractText": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can lead to unplanned care in patients with cancer, which may affect their prognosis and survival. We aimed to compare the rates, timing, and length of stay of unplanned CVD readmission in hospitalized patients with and without cancer. This study used the 2017-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify adult hospitalized patients with and without cancer. The primary outcome was 180-day unplanned CVD readmission rates. CVD was defined based on a composite variable that included atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and stroke. For patients readmitted due to CVD, the timing between admissions (based on the mean number of days between index hospitalization and readmission) and length of stay were further identified. After matching, 300,398 patients were included in the two groups. The composite CVD readmission rates were significantly higher in patients with cancer (5.92% vs 4.10%; odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% CI 1.44-1.51, p < 0.001). Patients with cancer were also associated with shorter mean number of days to composite CVD readmission (60.48 days vs 68.32 days, p < 0.001) and longer length of stay of composite CVD readmission (8.21 days vs 7.13 days, p < 0.001). These trends were maintained in analyses of the individual CVD. Hospitalized patients with cancer experienced higher rates of unplanned readmission due to CVD, and their CVD readmissions occurred sooner and required longer lengths of stay compared to patients without cancer. Efforts to reduce unplanned CVD readmissions, such as providing optimized chronic post-discharge care, may improve the health outcomes of patients with cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have shown promising survival outcomes with additional treatments to the traditional endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative (HER2-negative) advanced breast cancer (aBC). However, the head-to-head cardiovascular safety profile of these three agents (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) remains unclear. We summarized the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and hypertension associated with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitor in randomized control trials (RCTs) and compared the risks of MACE and hypertension through network-meta analysis (NMA). A systematic search through PubMed and Cochrane Library was performed to identify phase III RCTs reporting cardiovascular safety data of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with aBC. We qualitatively synthesized the incidence of MACE and hypertension associated with CDK4/6 inhibitor use within on-treatment or placebo-controlled duration. A Bayesian NMA with random-effects models was performed, and pairwise comparisons between treatment options were presented by odds ratio (OR). The probability of each treatment arm's relative ranking was reported using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method. Nine RCTs with four unique treatment arms and event(s) in at least one arm were included in the NMA. A total of 5218 patients were analyzed for MACE outcomes. The overall incidence of MACE in the CDK4/6 inhibitors+ET arm was 0.8%, while the endocrine therapy alone group was 0.4%. Abemaciclib+ET ranked the best in reducing the risk of MACE (SUCRA = 0.90) as compared to ET alone (SUCRA = 0.67, OR = 0.45, 95% credible interval (CI) = 0.07-2.82), palbociclib+ET (SUCRA = 0.25, OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.00-2.39) and ribociclib+ET (SUCRA = 0.17, OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.00-1.18). The findings were similar in the MH network. However, abemaciclib+ET (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81) had a significantly lower risk of MACE than ribociclib+ET in the MH network. No statistically significant differences in hypertension were shown among all comparisons. Abemaciclib+ET may have a lower risk of MACE for the treatment of aBC, while palbociclib+ET may reduce the risk of hypertension in this population. Our findings suggest a comparative cardiovascular safety trend among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, but further research on direct comparisons is needed to guide treatment choice.",

Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a novel inflammation biomarker, has been proposed as a predictor for cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between the level of FAR and long-term mortality including all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, remains unknown in CAD patients, especially those with prediabetes. We enrolled 66,761 CAD patients from 2007 to 2020 from a multi-center registry cohort study. The primary outcomes were the all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. FAR was calculated using the following formula: Fibrinogen (g/L)/Albumin (g/L). Patients were divided into three groups by FAR tertile (low FAR (FAR-L), median FAR (FAR-M), high FAR (FAR-H)), and further categorized into 9 groups according to FAR and glucose metabolism status (normal glucose regulation (NGR), prediabetes mellitus (PreDM), diabetes mellitus (DM)). Cox regression models and competing risk models were used to examine the relationships between FAR and clinical outcomes. 66,761 patients (63.1 \u00b1 11.0 years, 75.3% male) were enrolled. During the follow-up, 10,534 patients died, including 4991 cardiovascular deaths and 1092 cancer deaths. After adjusting for confounders, higher FAR was associated with increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in CAD patients with NGR, PreDM and DM. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was highest in FAR-H with DM (HR (95% CI) = 1.71 (1.58-1.86), 2.11 (1.86-2.38), respectively; p < 0.001). FAR-H with PreDM was significantly associated with the highest risk of cancer mortality (HR (95% CI) = 2.27 (1.70-3.02), p < 0.001). Adding FAR to the original model significantly improved the prediction of long-term mortality. Increased FAR was significantly associated with higher risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in CAD patients with NGR, PreDM and DM.

        "AbstractText": "Diabetic neuropathy is a well-known complication of diabetes. Recently, hyperglycemia-induced toxicity has been confirmed to participates in multiple cellular pathways typical for neural deterioration. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase/pre-b cell colony-enhancing factor (Nampt/PBEF)/visfatin is a novel endogenous ligand that some studies have shown its neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that visfatin may prevent high glucose (HG)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses properly. In this study, pheochromocytoma cell line 12 (PC12) cells were exposed to both HG concentrations (50, 75, 100, 125, 150 mM) and visfatin (50, 100, 150 ng/mL) at different time -points to determine the optimum time and dose of glucose and visfatin. To investigate the effects of visfatin on HG-induced damage in the PC12 diabetic neuropathy model, we examined ROS response, apoptosis, and autophagy using ROS detection kit, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR/Western blot, respectively. We determined that HG concentration significantly increased the ROS level and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells. However, visfatin treatment significantly decreased the ROS production (P<0.05) and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells (P<0.0001). Beclin-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level (P<0.05) and light chain 3 (Lc3)-II protein level (P<0.05) showed that the autophagy pathway is impaired by HG concentrations. We concluded that visfatin can sufficiently decrease neural damage caused by ROS production and apoptosis under HG-induced toxicity. High glucose significantly increased the ROS level and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells;The autophagy pathway is impaired by high glucose;Nampt/PBEF/visfatin can significantly reduce neural damage caused by ROS production and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a failure in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Visfatin (Nampt/PBEF) has insulin-mimetic effects. So far, no study has assessed its effects on diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, we examined the neuroprotective effects of visfatin on cell line 12 (PC12) against glucose-induced neurotoxicity. Based on the results, it was concluded that the Nampt/PBEF/visfatin can significantly reduce neural damage caused by production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cell.",

A rare cause of ACTH-dependent endogenous hypercorticism is ACTH-ectopic syndrome (ACTH-ES) (about 15-20% of cases).

        "AbstractText": "The progressive improvement of the classification using modern analytical methods is an essential tool for the development of precise and personalized approaches to the treatment of pituitary adenomas. In recent years, endocrinologists have witnessed evolutionary changes that have occurred in the histopathological identification of pituitary neoplasms, revealing new possibilities for studying tumorigenesis and predicting biological behavior.The paper considers the historical aspects of the gradual improvement of the classification of pituitary adenomas, as well as the new international 2022 WHO classification, according to which pituitary adenomas are included in the list of neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) to reflect the biological aggressiveness of some non-metastatic pituitary adenomas. The characteristics of pituitary adenoma are presented, as well as a list of histological subtypes of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors of the pituitary gland, marked by the main potentials for invasive growth, an increased risk of recurrence and a negative clinical prognosis.The expediency of changing the definition of \u00abpituitary adenoma\u00bb to \u00abneuroendocrine tumor\u00bb is discussed. It is emphasized that the introduction of a unified clinical, laboratory and morphological protocol into national clinical practice will help provide comparable comparative studies on the prognosis of the disease and the effectiveness of secondary therapy and also contribute to adequate management of potentially aggressive PitNETs.

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, a large number of studies have been carried out to research molecular genetic abnormalities in ACTH--secreting pituitary tumors. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of exome studies results (germline and somatic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities in corticotropinomas which developed as part of hereditary syndromes\u00a0MEN 1, 2, 4, DICER1, Carney complex etc., and isolated tumors, respectively) and transcriptome (specific genes expression profiles in hormonally active and inactive corticotropinomas, regulation of cell cycles and signal pathways). Modern technologies (next-generation sequencing - NGS) allow us to study the state of the microRNAome, DNA methylome and\u00a0inactive chromatin sites, in particular using RNA sequencing. Thus, a wide range of fundamental studies is shown, the\u00a0results of which allow us to identify and comprehend the key previously known and new pathogenesis mechanisms and\u00a0biomarkers of corticotropinomas. The characteristics of the most promising molecular genetic factors that can be used in clinical practice for screening and earlier diagnosis of hereditary syndromes and isolated corticotropinomas, differential diagnosis of various forms of endogenous hypercorticism, sensitivity to existing and potential therapies and\u00a0personalized outcome determination of Cushing`s disease. \u0417\u0430

        "AbstractText": "Pericardial effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. In nations with high tuberculosis (TB) load, TB is the most common cause of pericardial effusion. 1-2% of patients with pulmonary TB develop Pericardial TB worldwide. Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB, including extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases, are rising in number. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, which has certain immune functions in the body. ADA levels are increased in inflammatory conditions, like pleural, pericardial, or joint effusions, of bacterial etiology, granulomatous conditions, neoplasms, and autoimmune pathologies. TB is the only lymphocytosis involving disease with increased ADA levels. MDR EPTB is rare, but cases are on the rise, and tuberculous pericardial effusion is one such example. Hence, it is important to know the percentage of cases detected by a culture that can be identified by cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT), their resistance patterns, and to identify potential markers like ADA, which can help in early identification of cases. The objectives of this study were to identify the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli in culture, and correlate them with cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) results and their drug-resistance, in the Pericardial tubercular effusion, and to find if Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) levels can be used as a predictor of the presence of MTB in pericardial fluid. We enrolled 52 patients with moderate to large tuberculous pericardial effusion, based on pericardial fluid analysis, CBNAAT, and culture methods, between January 2021 and December 2021. The mean age of the patients was 41.85\u00a0+\u00a017.88 years, with a median of 38 years. Males made up 57.7% of the total patients. MTB was detected in 16 (30.8%) patients in the CBNAAT evaluations. 14 (87.5%) of the CBNAAT-positive TB patients were sensitive to Rifampicin, whereas the remaining 2 (12.5%) were resistant to Rifampicin on CBNAAT. MTB was found to be growing in 8 (15.38%) drug sensitivity test cultures. Out of these 8, 6 were sensitive to first-line drugs, whereas 2 were resistant to both Isoniazid and Rifampicin. The presence of cough was found to have a significant difference between CBNAAT-detected MTB positive and negative patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), whereas an insignificant difference was found for the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyspnea, or fever. There was also an insignificant difference between the number of patients positive for the Tuberculin skin test, between the two groups. ADA was significantly higher in the MTB-detected CBNAAT group (85.91\u00a0+\u00a037.60U/L vs 39.78\u00a0+\u00a024.31U/L, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), whereas the total leukocyte count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, random blood sugar levels, and serum protein levels had no significant difference. The area under the Receiver Operator Curve (CBNAAT positive: dependent variable; ADA: test result variable) was 0.854 (null hypothesis rejected), with a standard error of 0.078. Culture is the gold standard method to diagnose tuberculosis. Detection of MTB on pericardial fluid culture is very uncommon, though in our study, culture came out positive in 16% of patients, and 4% were resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid. Higher ADA levels in pericardial fluid are an indicator of tuberculous pericardial effusion.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Factors associated with treatment adherence among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in New Delhi.",
        "AbstractText": "TB is treated with a six-month course of four antimicrobial drugs, and nearly all cases of TB can be cured if the medications are given and taken correctly. Due to its prolong treatment plans, there can be reasons associated with non-adherence to treatment by TB patients. Hence, the present study aimed to explore the factors associated with medication adherence among TB patients. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients enrolled under RNTCP (now NTEP) in New Delhi among 27 functional RNTCP districts. Around 200\u00a0TB patients who are enrolled in the Nikshay App and are also on treatment were considered. A structured questionnaire was prepared for the interview guide. Analysis was done using bivariate analysis, chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Among the total participants, 173 (86.5%) were adherent and the remaining 27 (13.5%) participants were non-adherent. The majority of the participants (91%) said they were able to follow the routine to the DOTS center, and 9% said they find it difficult to report to the DOTS center as per their schedule. Only 12.35% of non-adherent participants were seen among those who get regular reminders from their families to take medicines, as compared to 18.42% among those who did not get regular reminders from their families. More than one-fourth of the participants (25.9%) who report not getting necessary motivation from healthcare providers were non-adherent. Motivation by healthcare workers to follow drug schedules was found statistically significant to treatment compliance with a P-value of 0.0422. TB is a curable disease; this belief has turned out to be a motivational factor for patients suffering from this disease. Studies have shown that faith in the efficacy of treatment helps adherence to TB treatment while other studies describe how patient adherence was adversely affected by the belief that TB is incurable or the treatment is inefficient or that alternative treatment such as traditional medicine is better.",

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of ChatGPT in radiation oncology-related domains, including answering common patient questions, summarizing landmark clinical research studies, and providing literature reviews with specific references supporting current standard-of-care clinical practice in radiation oncology. We assessed the performance of ChatGPT version 3.5 (ChatGPT3.5) in 3 areas. We evaluated ChatGPT3.5's ability to answer 28 templated patient-centered questions applied across 9 cancer types. We then tested ChatGPT3.5's ability to summarize specific portions of 10 landmark studies in radiation oncology. Next, we used ChatGPT3.5 to identify scientific studies supporting current standard-of-care practice in clinical radiation oncology for 5 different cancer types. Each response was graded independently by 2 reviewers, with discordant grades resolved by a third reviewer. ChatGPT3.5 frequently generated inaccurate or incomplete responses. Only 39.7% of responses to patient-centered questions were considered correct and comprehensive. When summarizing landmark studies in radiation oncology, 35.0% of ChatGPT3.5's responses were accurate and comprehensive, improving to 43.3% when provided the full text of the study. ChatGPT3.5's ability to present a list of studies related to standard-of-care clinical practices was also unsatisfactory, with 50.6% of the provided studies fabricated. ChatGPT should not be considered a reliable radiation oncology resource for patients or providers at this time, as it frequently generates inaccurate or incomplete responses. However, natural language programming-based artificial intelligence programs are rapidly evolving, and future versions of ChatGPT or similar programs may demonstrate improved performance in this domain.",

        "AbstractText": "Radiation therapy (RT) is a frontline approach to treating cancer. While the target of radiation dose delivery is the tumor, there is an inevitable spill of dose to nearby normal organs causing complications. This phenomenon is known as radiotherapy toxicity. To predict the outcome of the toxicity, statistical models can be built based on dosimetric variables received by the normal organ at risk (OAR), known as Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) models. To tackle the challenge of the high dimensionality of dosimetric variables and limited clinical sample sizes, statistical models with variable selection techniques are viable choices. However, existing variable selection techniques are data-driven and do not integrate medical domain knowledge into the model formulation. We propose a knowledge-constrained generalized linear model (KC-GLM). KC-GLM includes a new mathematical formulation to translate three pieces of domain knowledge into non-negativity, monotonicity, and adjacent similarity constraints on the model coefficients. We further propose an equivalent transformation of the KC-GLM formulation, which makes it possible to solve the model coefficients using existing optimization solvers. Furthermore, we compare KC-GLM and several well-known variable selection techniques via a simulation study and on two real datasets of prostate cancer and lung cancer, respectively. These experiments show that KC-GLM selects variables with better interpretability, avoids producing counter-intuitive and misleading results, and has better prediction accuracy.",

        "AbstractText": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid cancer. The critical importance of circular RNA (circRNA) in a range of cancer types has been lately recognized. However, research on the functions of circRNAs in PTC has been limited thus far. Therefore, this research aimed at exploring the function and mechanism of circ-methyltransferase-like 15 (METTL15) in PTC cells. Quantitative measurements of circ-METTL15, miR-200c-3p, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in PTC cells were conducted using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis. To investigate cell growth, cell counting kit-8 and colony formation tests were employed, apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry, and migration and invasion were studied through Transwell assays. The targeted binding sites between miR-200c-3p and circ-METTL15 or XIAP were predicted by starBase and then verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. circ-METTL15 and XIAP were upregulated in the PTC cells, while miR-200c-3p was downregulated. Downregulating circ-METTL15 or upregulating miR-200c-3p resulted in inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells, while promoting apoptosis. miR-200c-3p was the downstream molecule of circ-METTL15, and XIAP was the direct target of miR-200c-3p. Forcing XIAP expression obstructed circ-METTL15 silencing to inhibit PTC cell activity. By coopting miR-200c-3p/XIAP, Circ-METTL15 stimulates aggressive behavior in PTC cells.",

Data from 69 patients 0-18 years of age diagnosed between December 2001 and October 2019 were analyzed in April 2023. Patients received MRC-AML10 chemotherapy (2ADE+MACE+MidAC). No maintenance chemotherapy or preventive cranial radiotherapy was administered. Twelve patients with Down syndrome and 15 patients with promyelocytic leukemia were in the cohort. Patients with Down syndrome received reduced chemotherapy (cumulative anthracycline 420 mg/m2, cytarabine 3.4 g/m2, etoposide 1400 mg/m2). ATRA was added to chemotherapy in promyelocytic leukemia. Four patients (5.8%) died in the induction (two typhlitis, one intracranial hemorrhage, and one resistant disease). The complete remission rate of 66 patients was 87.8%. There was one death due to cardiotoxicity. Total infection-related deaths were 7.2%. Seven patients with high-risk criteria and one with resistant disease underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following the first-line treatment. All seven patients in remission were alive and disease-free. The relapse rate was 34.4% (n = 21). Four patients developing marrow relapse were disease-free in the second remission after salvage and maintenance chemotherapy. Thirteen patients (18.84%) underwent HSCT in the second remission and 8 are alive and disease-free. The mean follow-up period of patients from diagnosis was 185 \u00b1 13 months. Thirty-four patients (49.2%) were alive and disease-free in the first remission whereas another two patients in the first remission developed secondary malignancy.

Oncology patients \u226418 years at diagnosis who later had RRPD were identified retrospectively via registry at the only quaternary paediatric oncology centre in British Columbia (BC). We determined if distance to home, as calculated using geocoding software, was predictive of trial offer or enrolment. Between January 2015 and July 2021, 266 patients experienced 396 RRPD events.

COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) plays a vital role in development of some human cancers such as lung, colon and breast. It is a potent enzyme that is important for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. These prostaglandins mediate cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis which contributes to carcinogenesis. Overexpression of COX-2 has been detected in several malignancies including breast cancer. COX-2 overexpression is regarded as a poor prognostic marker of breast cancer.The present study will aim to study the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in breast cancer and compare it with known histopathological parameters thus assessing its prognostic value. This will be an observational study conducted in the Department of Pathology, JNMC, Wardha (Sawangi). Radical mastectomy specimens will be studied for COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry in patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma. COX-2 expression will be quantified as immunohistochemical score and results will be correlated with various histopathological parameters. The expected result of our study will suggest an association of COX-2 expression to the factors associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. A positive correlation is expected between larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher T stage and N stage and lymphovascular invasion. Conclusions will be drawn from the obtained results of the immunohistochemical study by using COX-2- for detection of overexpression of COX-2 when evaluated with TNM staging, histological grading and molecular types of breast cancer.",

This study aimed to assess the beneficial impact of the use of medium-molecular-weight (MMW)-HES and trisodium citrate combination over ACD-A in granulocyte apheresis when using Spectra Optia. This was a retrospective study comparing granulocyte harvest results with the use of ACD or HES and trisodium citrate combination. All the donors in both the groups received single 600 \u03bcg of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor subcutaneous injection followed by 8 mg of dexamethasone tablet 10-12 h and omnacortil 60 mg orally 3 h before harvest. A number of adverse incidents, if any, were observed and noted. Donor/procedure parameters were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test/unpaired t-test. Granulocyte yield (mean: 3.29 \u00d7 1010/unit vs. 4.5 \u00d7 1010/unit in the ACD and HES groups, respectively, P \u2264 0.0001) was significantly better in the HES group.

We prospectively examined the associations of oral health and healthy lifestyle factors with cancer risk among 0.5 million rural and urban residents from the China Kadoorie Biobank (2004-2015). Oral health status was assessed from self-reported baseline questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle index comprising non-smoking, non-drinking, ideal body shape, physical activity and healthy diet was calculated for each participant, and categorized into favorable, intermediate and unfavorable lifestyle behavior. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) relating oral health and healthy lifestyle index to cancer risk using Cox proportional hazards models. We estimated the population attributable risk percent (PAR%) and 95% CIs using multivariate models. During a median follow-up of 9 years, 23,805 new cancer cases were documented, with 52% from rural areas and 48% from urban areas. Compared with those with good oral health and favorable lifestyle, participants with poor oral health and unfavorable lifestyle had a higher risk of developing cancer in both rural (adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.39-1.74]; P for trend < 0.001) and urban areas (adjusted HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.24-1.67]; P for trend < 0.001).

Individuals with LA-NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Tumor burden signature-based OS prediction models were established using a nomogram and two machine-learning methods, the interpretable eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) risk prediction model, and DeepHit time-to-event neural network. The models' prediction performances were compared using the concordance index (C-index) and the area under the curve (AUC).

However, recent studies have demonstrated that senescent tumor cells, which could spontaneously exist within cancer tissues or arise in response to various cancer interventions (the so-called therapy-induced senescence, TIS), can acquire pro-tumorigenic properties and are capable of driving local and metastatic relapse. This highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of cellular senescence in cancer biology. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the pathological function of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells and discuss possible mechanisms by which tumor cell senescence contributes to cancer relapse.

Combined with the results from random forests, LASSO regression, and immunohistochemical results from the HPA database, we identified three candidate proteins (GSTP1, CSRP1, and LY6G6F) that could together distinguish CLGD (AUC = 0.91), CHGD (AUC = 0.99) and CGC (AUC = 0.98) from healthy controls with excellent accuracy. The panel of protein biomarkers showed promising diagnostic potential for CGC and precancerous lesions. Further validation and a larger-scale study are warranted to assess its potential clinical applications, suggesting a potential avenue for CGC prevention in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) stands as a profoundly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy, manifesting a discouragingly limited response to conventional therapeutic interventions. Within the intricate tapestry of the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerge as pivotal constituents, wielding the capacity to propel the malignant attributes of neoplastic cells while bolstering their deftness in thwarting treatments. The rapid evolution of nanomedicinal technologies ushers in fresh avenues for therapeutic paradigms meticulously honed to target CAFs. Notably, a recent proposition by Yuan et al. introduces a PDAC treatment strategy metaphorically akin to \"shooting fish in a barrel.\" By adeptly capitalizing on the spatial distribution of the CAF barricade encircling the tumor, this innovative approach orchestrates a metamorphosis of CAFs, transitioning them from impediments to drug delivery into reservoirs of therapeutic agents. The resultant outcome, an augmentation of chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, attests to the transformative potential of this concept. The study not only bequeaths novel insights and methodologies to surmount barriers in drug delivery for tumor treatment but also holds promise in elevating the precision, efficacy, and safety of tailored therapeutic regimens. Within this discourse, we meticulously evaluate Yuan et al.'s research, scrutinizing its merits and limitations, and cast a forward-looking gaze upon the formulation, validation of efficacy, and clinical translation of nanomedicines targeting CAFs.",

Hybrid analysis, a combination of cohort and period analysis, has been proposed to derive up-to-date cancer survival estimates. Using this approach, we aimed to timely and accurately analyze the 5-year relative survival (RS) and net survival (NS) in cancer registries of Zhejiang Province, China. A total of 255,725 new cancer cases diagnosed during 2013-2017 were included in 14 cancer registries in Zhejiang Province, China, with a follow-up on vital status until the end of 2019. The hybrid analysis was used to calculate the 5-year RS and 5-year NS during 2018-2019 for overall and stratifications by sex, cancer type, region, and age at diagnosis. During 2018-2019, the age-standardized 5-year RS and NS for overall cancer in Zhejiang was 47.5% and 48.6%, respectively. The age-standardized 5-year RS for cancers of women (55.4%) was higher than that of men (40.0%), and the rate of urban areas (49.7%) was higher than that of rural areas (43.1%). The 5-year RS declined along with age, from 84.4% for ages <45 years to 23.7% for ages >74 years. Our results of the RS and NS showed the similar trend and no significant difference. The top five cancers with top age-standardized 5-year RS were thyroid cancer (96.0%), breast cancer (84.3%), testicular cancer (79.9%), prostate cancer (77.2%), and bladder cancer (70.6%), and the five cancers with the lowest age-standardized 5-year RS were pancreatic cancer (6.0%), liver cancer (15.6%), gallbladder cancer (17.1%), esophageal cancer (22.7%), and leukemia (31.0%). We reported the most up-to-date 5-year cancer RS and NS in Zhejiang Province, China for the first time, and found that the 5-year survival for cancer patients in Zhejiang during 2018-2019 was relatively high.

Brentuximab vedotin (BV) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have important roles in the salvage treatment of R/R HL. However, subsequent treatment for HL refractory to BV and/or ICI treatment is challenging. We retrospectively analyzed patients in two institutions who had R/R HL, experienced BV or ICI treatment failure, and received radiotherapy (RT) thereafter. The overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Overall, 19 patients were enrolled. First-line systemic therapy comprised doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD, 84.2%); AVD plus ICIs (10.5%); and bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP, 5.3%). After first-line therapy, 15 (78.9%) and four patients (21.1%) had refractory disease and relapsed, respectively. After R/R HL diagnosis, six (31.6%), two (10.5%), and 11 (57.9%) patients received BV and ICIs concurrently, BV monotherapy, and ICI monotherapy, respectively. All patients received intensity-modulated RT (n = 12, 63.2%) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT; n = 7, 36.8%). The ORR as well as the complete response (CR) rate was 100%; the median DOR to RT was 17.2 months (range, 7.9-46.7 months). Two patients showed progression outside the radiation field; one patient had extensive in-field, out-of-field, nodal, and extranodal relapse. With a median follow-up time of 16.2 months (range, 9.2-23.2 months), the 1-year PFS and OS were 84.4% and 100%, respectively. PFS was associated with extranodal involvement (P = 0.019) and gross tumor volume (P = 0.044). All patients tolerated RT well without adverse events of grade \u2265 3.

We demonstrate that NP core stiffness determines the magnitude of transport, while surface chemistry directs intracellular trafficking. Finally, we demonstrate that these factors similarly dictate in vivo BBB transport using intravital imaging through cranial windows in mice. We identify that hyaluronic acid surface chemistry increases transport across the BBB in vivo, and flow conditions are necessary to replicate this finding in vitro.

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms implicated have remained ambiguous. In present study, the model of HCC was set up by the 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)/partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats. To confirm the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the microarray analysis, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted. In the meantime, the liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS) was employed to characterize the component profile of DWYG. Consequently, the DWYG treatment exhibited the ability to reverse 51 variation genes induced by 2-AAF/PH. Additionally, there was an overlap of 54 variation genes between the normal and model groups. Upon conducting RT-qPCR analysis, it was observed that the expression levels of all genes were increased by 2-AAF/PH and subsequently reversed after DWYG treatment. Notably, the fold change of expression levels for all genes was below 0.5, with 3 genes falling below 0.25. Moreover, an investigation was conducted to determine the signaling pathway that was activated/inhibited in the HCC group and subsequently reversed in the DWYG group. Moreover, the component profile of DWYG encompassed a comprehensive compilation of 206 compounds that were identified or characterized. The findings of this study elucidated the potential alleviative mechanisms of DWYG in the context of HCC, thereby holding significant implications for its future clinical utilization and widespread adoption.",

When the incidence of early (stage 0-II) and advanced (stage III-IV) HNC cancers was compared, the proportion of patients with early-stage cancer declined. Among them, significant primary tumor progression was observed in T classification. The number of patients with no subjective symptoms at initial diagnosis was decreasing significantly. A decrease in the proportion of HNC patients with early-stage cancer and primary tumor progression was observed after the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

We aimed to examine the relationship between the extent of bone resection and postoperative outcomes in patients with mandibular MRONJ. The clinical and imaging findings and treatment outcomes of 206 patients (258 surgeries) with mandibular MRONJ undergoing surgery were reviewed. Imaging findings were evaluated using computed tomography (CT) to sequestrum, osteolysis, periosteal reaction, and mixed-type osteosclerosis, and determine the extent of resection. In some cases, samples were taken from within the bone, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of bacteria and fungi. The three-year cumulative cure rate was 81.7%. Patients with malignant tumors showing no osteolysis and undergoing sequestrum removal or marginal mandibulectomy had significantly worse prognosis than those with osteoporosis showing osteolysis and undergoing segmental mandibulectomy. Furthermore, patients with residual osteolysis, periosteal reactions, and mixed-type osteosclerosis on CT were more likely to develop recurrence. Eleven patients showed no osteolysis on CT images. Patients with cancer administered with high-dose denosumab had significantly poorer prognosis. Bacteria and fungi were also detected in samples obtained from gap-type periosteal reaction and mixed-type osteosclerosis. Surgery for MRONJ requires resection of the infected bone. Aside from the osteolysis area, the gap-/irregular-type periosteal reaction and mixed-type osteosclerosis must also be included in the resection area. Methods for determining the extent of bone resection in MRONJ without osteolysis are a future challenge.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma is one of the most devastating central nervous system disorders. Being a highly vascular brain tumor, it is distinguished by aberrant vessel architecture. This lends credence to the idea that endothelial cells (ECs) linked with glioblastoma vary fundamentally from ECs seen in the healthy human brain. To effectively design an antiangiogenic treatment, it is crucial to identify the functional and phenotypic characteristics of tumor-associated ECs. The ECs associated with glioblastoma are less prone to apoptosis than control cells and are resistant to cytotoxic treatments. Additionally, ECs associated with glioblastoma migrate more quickly than control ECs and naturally produce large amounts of growth factors such as endothelin-1, interleukin-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For designing innovative antiangiogenic drugs that particularly target tumor-related ECs in gliomas, it is critical to comprehend these distinctive features of ECs associated with gliomas. This review discusses the process of angiogenesis, other factors involved in the genesis of tumors, and the possibility of ECs as a potential target in combating glioblastoma. It also sheds light on the association of tumor microenvironment and ECs with immunotherapy. This review, thus gives us the hope that neuro endothelial targeting with growth factors and angiogenesis regulators combined with gene therapy would open up new doorways and change our traditional perspective of treating cancer.",

All ES-SCLC patients without initial brain metastases who completed \u2265 4 cycles of systemic therapy at Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 2012 to 2021 were included in this retrospective study. We correlated the site of first recurrence to the post-chemotherapy-based radiation volume (small-field). Relapse pattern, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between those received and did not receive consolidation RT. A total of 152 patients were followed up for a median of 31.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-39.6 months). The median PFS and OS of the cohort were 8.3 months (IQR, 6.1-11.2 months) and 16.2 months (IQR, 9.9-24.9 months), respectively. Thoracic consolidation RT served not only as an independent prognostic factor for improved PFS in the entire cohort, but also significantly prolonged OS in the subgroup without synchronous liver metastases. Small-field consolidation RT markedly reduced in-field recurrences (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12-0.38]; P < 0.001) without increasing out-of-field recurrences (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.13-1.16]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.080).

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of lung cancer patients treated at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2005 and 2018. Inclusion criteria was clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent resection during this period. Sub-analyses were performed for the three types of N classifications.

However, a lack of recognized pre-clinical TME-based risk models poses a great challenge to investigating the risk factors correlated with prognosis and treatment responses for patients with ccRCC. Stromal and immune contexture were assessed to calculate the TMErisk score of a large sample of patients with ccRCC from public and real-world cohorts using machine-learning algorithms. Next, analyses for prognostic efficacy, correlations with clinicopathological features, functional enrichment, immune cell distributions, DNA variations, immune response, and heterogeneity were performed and validated. Clinical hub genes, including INAFM2, SRPX, DPYSL3, VSIG4, APLNR, FHL5, A2M, SLFN11, ADAMTS4, IFITM1, NOD2, CCR4, HLA-DQB2, and PLAUR, were identified and incorporated to develop the TMErisk signature. Patients in the TMEhigh risk group (category) exhibited a considerably grim prognosis, and the TMErisk model was shown to independently function as a risk indicator for the overall survival (OS) of ccRCC patients. Expression levels of immune checkpoint genes were substantially increased in TMEhigh risk group, while those of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family genes were prominently decreased. In addition, tumors in the TMEhigh group showed significantly high infiltration levels of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, including M2 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and CD4+ T cells. In heterogeneity analysis, more frequent somatic mutations, including pro-tumorigenic BAP1 and PBRM1, were observed in the TMEhigh group. Importantly, 19.3% of patients receiving immunotherapies in the TMEhigh group achieved complete or partial response compared with those with immune tolerance in the TMElow group, suggesting that TMErisk prominently differentiates prognosis and responses to immunotherapy for patients with ccRCC. We first established the TMErisk score of ccRCC using machine-learning algorithms based on a large-scale population. The TMErisk score can be utilized as an innovative independent prognosis predictive marker with high sensitivity and accuracy. Our discovery also predicted the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC patients, indicating the intimate link between tumor immune microenvironment and intratumoral heterogeneity.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Dynamic toxicity landscape of immunotherapy for solid tumors across treatment lines.",
        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) have been widely studied and applied throughout the course of cancer treatment. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive profile of ICI-associated toxicity and elucidate the toxicity patterns of ICIs across different treatment lines. In total, 155 cohorts comprising 24 539 eligible patients were included in the safety analysis. Trial name, registration number, cancer type, trial phase, clinical setting, trial design, regimen, dosing schedule, age, sex and ethnicity distributions, number of patients, number of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs), and number of treatment-related death were extracted. We defined a timeline from the neoadjuvant setting to the third-line setting. We also introduced a synthesizing principle for adverse event rates (SPAER) of immunotherapy to ensure the comparability and reliability across different treatment lines. The study protocol was registered and approved by the PROSPERO protocol review committee (CRD42021242368). After excluding the neoadjuvant setting group, we observed a distinct reduction in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) with an advancement of the line of ICI treatment. The incidence of trAEs was negatively correlated with the line of treatment, irrespective of whether monotherapy or dual-ICI combination therapy was administered. Sensitivity analyses also confirmed the coincident negative correlations. In summary, using a timeline-based concept centered around treatment lines, we revealed the dynamic landscape of ICI-associated toxicity and found that patients treated with ICIs during later lines of therapy may have a lower risk of trAEs.",

        "AbstractText": "Colonoscopy with histopathological analysis of mucosal biopsy samples remains the gold standard procedure for diagnosing lower gastrointestinal disorders. This study aimed to determine the pattern of histopathological findings of mucosal biopsies obtained at colonoscopy over a 7-year period and to correlate the histological findings with the clinical profile of the patients. This was a retrospective study conducted in a healthcare facility in southwestern Nigeria. The Histology reports from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2022, were retrieved from the histopathology department of the institution to obtain the following information for analysis: age, gender, year of the test, presenting complaint, provisional clinical diagnosis, colonoscopy diagnosis, and histological diagnosis. The data of a total number of 81 patients were analyzed; 51 males (63.0%) and 30 females (37.0%) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.7-1. The age range of the patients was 30-86 years with a mean (\u00b1standard deviations) age of 59.87 \u00b1 14.44. The most common indication for colonoscopy was hematochezia (23 (28.4%)) followed by change in bowel habit (16 [19.8%]), constipation (11 [13.6%]), and tenesmus (10 [12.3%]). Large bowel masses suggestive of cancers were the most common colonoscopy finding in the study subjects (36 [44.4%]). Colorectal cancer was the most common histologic abnormality in the study subjects (26 [32.1%]) followed by chronic nonspecific colitis (8 [9.9%]), polyps (7 [8.6%]), adenomas (5 [6.2%]) and acute on chronic colitis (5 [6.2%]). Twenty-two (27.2%) patients had normal histologic findings. Patients aged between 45 and 64 years had the highest prevalence of colorectal cancer (13 [50.0%]). Colorectal cancer was the most common histopathological finding in this study and the patients were mostly within the middle-age group. Early screening colonoscopy is therefore recommended and histopathological analysis of the mucosal specimens obtained is essential for early detection of premalignant lesions.

Although musculoskeletal tumors are rare, hand localized tumors are even rarer in pediatric patients. The fact that very few (less than one in ten) tumors are malignant and there are dozens of subtypes, each with different treatment management, shows the importance of the management of these lesions. Appropriate diagnosis and management of soft tissue masses, especially insidious malignant tumors, is vital. Due to the rarity of soft tissue tumors, adequate guidelines for their management are limited. The purpose of this report is to present an example of the approach to one of the soft tissue tumors.",

The abdominal complaints were gone during the initial follow-up, but the patient developed sciatica radiating to the right foot and electric shock-like pain. A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy revealed a low-grade mesenchymal neoplasm of the soft tissues with characteristics consistent with a solitary extrapleural fibrous tumor. The pelvis team of the orthopedics department received the patient for surgical excision of the lesion. The procedure occurred with no complications, and we excised the totality of the lesion with tumor-free margins. An anatomopathological examination was compatible with the biopsy assessment.

Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are widely used to treat stage IV NSCLC. This study systematically reviewed the literature to clarify the impact of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment on the survival of patients with stage III NSCLC. Randomized phase III clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors administered to patients with stage III NSCLC that were written in English and published between November 2012 and November 2022 were eligible for review. The sources of information were the MEDLINE database (last consulted on December 26, 2022), ScienceDirect website (last consulted on December 26, 2022), and CENTRAL register (last consulted on December 27, 2022). The outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS). Risk of bias assessments were performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 5.1.0. The findings have been assessed for certainty according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) guidelines. Fourteen eligible studies and 2788 participants were included in the review. The key characteristics used to group the participants were disease histology, percentage of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, and timeline of therapy. OS and PFS were improved (risk ratio [RR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.96 and RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.70-0.86, respectively) based on the use of PD-L1 inhibitors after chemoradiation and OS was improved using first-line PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy in non-squamous NSCLC (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.95), with the GRADE results indicating moderate quality of evidence. This review highlights the OS and PFS benefits of PD-L1 inhibitors in stage III NSCLC when used after chemoradiation and OS benefits of first-line PD-1 inhibitors added to chemotherapy in non-squamous stage III disease.",

In this retrospective cohort study, we used the SEER database to identify patients with metastatic vulvar cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2019. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the covariates. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models were used to analyze OS.

        "AbstractText": "Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs. Within the miR-545/374a cluster, miR-545 resides in the intron of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FTX on Xq13.2. The precursor form, pre-miR-545, is cleaved to generate two mature miRNAs, miR-545-3p and miR-545-5p. Remarkably, these two miRNAs exhibit distinct aberrant expression patterns in different cancers; however, their expression in colorectal cancer remains controversial. Notably, miR-545-3p is affected by 15 circular RNAs (circRNAs) and 10 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and it targets 27 protein-coding genes (PCGs) that participate in the regulation of four signaling pathways. In contrast, miR-545-5p is regulated by one circRNA and five lncRNAs, it targets six PCGs and contributes to the regulation of one signaling pathway. Both miR-545-3p and miR-545-5p affect crucial cellular behaviors, including cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and migration. Although low miR-545-3p expression is associated with poor prognosis in three cancer types, studies on miR-545-5p are yet to be reported. miR-545-3p operates within a diverse range of regulatory networks, thereby augmenting the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Conversely, miR-545-5p enhances immunotherapy efficacy by inhibiting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) expression. In summary, miR-545 holds immense potential as a cancer biomarker and therapeutic target. The aberrant expression and regulatory mechanisms of miR-545 in cancer warrant further investigation.",

The prognostic significance of body composition indicators, including visceral obesity, has been extensively investigated in patients with cancer. This study aimed to assess the impact of body composition indicators, specifically pretreatment fat content, on the survival outcomes of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. We retrospectively analyzed clinical information from patients diagnosed with stage IVB cervical cancer between 2010 and 2018. We measured visceral obesity (visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio [VSR]) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) on pretreatment computed tomography (CT) images. We evaluated the impact of these body composition parameters on the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. Overall, 116 patients were included, 81 of whom had complete clinical and imaging information. Based on the cut-off values from X-tile analysis, we categorized patients into high and low VSR and SMI groups. The overall survival (OS) rate of patients with a high VSR was significantly higher than that of patients with a low VSR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a low VSR was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. Visceral obesity before radiotherapy and chemotherapy has a protective effect on the prognosis of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer, while low muscle index and VSR are associated with poor prognosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Betel nut/areca nut/Areca catechu is one of the most commonly used psychoactive substance, and is also a major preventable cause of cancer. Unlike other psychoactive substances, such as nicotine, the mechanisms underlying addiction to areca nuts and related oncogenesis remain elusive. Recent reports suggest a possible overlap in the mechanisms of action of nicotine and areca nuts in the human body. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the interactome of human proteins associated with areca nut exposure and the intricate similarities and differences in the effects of the two psychoactive substances on humans. A list of proteins associated with areca nut use was obtained from the available literature using terms from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional enrichment were analyzed. The results obtained for both psychoactive substances were compared. Given the limited number of common proteins (36/226, 16%) in the two sets, a substantial overlap (612/1176 nodes, 52%) was observed in the PPI networks, as well as in Gene Ontology. Areca nuts mainly affect signaling pathways through three hub proteins (alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, tumor protein 53, and interleukin-6), which are common to both psychoactive substances, as well as two unique hub proteins (epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a0and\u00a0master regulator of cell cycle entry and proliferative metabolism). Areca nut-related proteins are associated with unique pathways, such as extracellular matrix organization, lipid storage, and metabolism, which are not found in nicotine-associated proteins. Areca nuts affect regulatory mechanisms, leading to systemic toxicity and oncogenesis. Areca nuts also affect unique pathways that can be studied as potential markers of exposure, as well as targets for anticancer therapeutic agents.",

CPP is characterized by well-defined circular or lobulated masses in the ventricles, leading to symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. CPP diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histological examination. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorizes choroid plexus tumors into CPP (Grade \u0406), atypical CPP (aCPP, Grade II), and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC, Grade III). This article reviewed current diagnostics modalities and explored the emergence of new diagnostic methods for CPP. Research on molecular markers and genetic alterations associated with CPP is ongoing, and some potential markers have been identified. These results offered insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalized treatment approaches for CPP. Advancements in radiomics and liquid biopsy hold promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring treatment outcomes for choroid plexus tumors. Radiomics can provide quantitative data from imaging studies, whereas liquid biopsy can analyze tumor-derived genetic material and molecular markers from body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. The rapidly evolving fields of molecular and genetic research and novel diagnostic methods require continuous updates and advancements before their application in clinical practice. We hope that these advancements will lead to earlier and more precise diagnoses, better treatment options, and improved outcomes in patients with CPP and other brain tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a novel anti-tumor therapeutic modality, are monoclonal antibodies targeting certain immune checkpoints (ICs) that reactivate T cells to achieve anti-tumor immunity by targeting, binding, and blocking ICs. Targeted inhibitory antibodies against the ICs cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen and programmed death receptor-1 have demonstrated efficacy and durable anti-tumor activity in patients with cancer. ICs may prevent autoimmune reactions. However, ICIs may disrupt ICs properties and trigger autoimmune-related adverse reactions involving various organ systems including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, musculoskeletal, dermal, and endocrine systems. Approximately 10% of patients with damage to target organs such as the thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal glands develop endocrine system immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as thyroid dysfunction, pituitary gland inflammation, diabetes mellitus, and primary adrenal insufficiency. However, the symptoms of immunotherapy-associated endocrine system irAEs may be nonspecific and similar to those of other treatment-related adverse reactions, and failure to recognize them early may lead to death. Timely detection and treatment of immunotherapy-associated endocrine irAEs is essential to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, prognosis, and the quality of life of patients. This study aimed to review the mechanisms by which ICIs cause endocrine irAEs providing guidance for the development of appropriate management protocols. Here, we discuss (1) the biological mechanisms of ICs in tumorigenesis and progression, focusing on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen and programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1; and (2) the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of four immunotherapy-related endocrine complications.",

        "AbstractText": "Dostarlimab, a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking IgG4 humanized monoclonal antibody, gained accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2021, and received a full approval in February 2023. Dostarlimab was approved for treating adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that progressed during or after prior treatment who have no other suitable treatment options. Herein, we review the structure-based mechanism of action of dostarlimab and the results of a clinical study (GARNET; NCT02715284) to comprehensively clarify the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. The efficacy and safety of dostarlimab as monotherapy was assessed in a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort trial that included 209 patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors after receiving systemic therapy. Patients received 500\u00a0mg of dostarlimab intravenously every three weeks until they were given four doses. Then, patients received 1000\u00a0mg dostarlimab intravenously every six weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The overall response rate, as determined by shrinkage in tumor size, was 41.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 34.9, 48.6), with 34.7 months as the median response duration. In conclusion, dostarlimab is an immunotherapy-based drug that has shown promising results in adult patients with recurrent or advanced dMMR EC. However, its efficacy in other cancer subtypes, the development of resistance to monotherapy, and efficacy and safety in combination with other immunotherapeutic drugs have not yet been studied.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Rehabilitation needs of people with brain tumours in Ireland: Protocol for a prospective, mixed methods action research study (\"Brain-RESTORE\").",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Approximately 480 people annually in Ireland are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour. Brain tumours are a heterogeneous group of conditions, varying in histopathology, location, and progression. A consistent feature is neurological impairment, which can lead to profound effects on physical and cognitive function. There is evidence that people with brain tumours can benefit from rehabilitation, but pathways are poorly described, and no best practice is defined. This leads to significant unmet need. The aim of this study is to understand the rehabilitation needs of people diagnosed with a brain tumour in Ireland, and gain insight to inform policy and practice. Methods: A prospective, mixed methods study with embedded action research will be conducted. Patients (n=122) with a new diagnosis of primary brain tumour, and optionally, a nominated carer or family member, will be recruited through a national neuro-oncology service. Rehabilitation need (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module, EuroQol-5D-5L), healthcare utilisation and, optionally, carer needs (Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool) will be assessed at four, eight and 12 months post diagnosis. An embedded qualitative study will invite 30 patients and carers to a semi-structured interview to explore their lived experience of rehabilitation needs and services following brain tumour diagnosis. Finally, using an Action Research approach, healthcare professionals involved in caring for people with brain tumours will be invited to participate in co-operative inquiry groups, to reflect on emerging aggregate findings and identify actions that could be undertaken while the study is underway. Conclusions: By understanding rehabilitation need, the findings will help healthcare professionals and health service providers understand how to prioritise the supports required and encourage policy makers to adequately resource neurorehabilitation to meet the needs of people with a brain tumour diagnosis.",

Regarding the high mortality rate and silent nature of CRC, screening and early detection can meaningfully reduce disease-related deaths. Therefore, for the first time, we aimed to evaluate the early non-invasive diagnosis of CRC via quantitative promoter methylation analysis of RUNX3 and RASSF1A genes in PBMCs. In the present study, we analyzed the methylation status of two important tumor suppressor genes including RUNX3 and RASSF1A in 70 CRC patients and 70 non-malignant subjects using methylation-quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA (MethyQESD), and a bisulfite conversion-independent method. RUNX3 was significantly hypermethylated in PBMCs of CRC patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). By determining the efficient cutoff value, the sensitivity, and specificity of RUNX3 promoter methylation for CRC diagnosis reached 84.28% and 77.14%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses demonstrated that RUNX3 promoter methylation has high accuracy (areas under the curve [AUC] = 0.840, P < 0.001) for discriminating CRC subjects from healthy individuals. Moreover, RUNX3 methylation levels in PBMCs progressively increased with the stage of the disease (P < 0.001). Although the amount of RASSF1A promoter methylation was not significantly different between CRC patients and controls as well as in different stages of the disease (P > 0.05). Our findings confirmed that PBMCs are reliable sources of methylation analysis for CRC screening, and RUNX3 promoter methylation can be used as a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of CRC.",

Animal models can play a part in gaining a deep understanding of such a process and addressing questions concerning developing and improving immunotherapy approaches. To develop such a model, we transfected murine 4T1 cells with the pCMV6-Neo-HER2 construct and evaluated HER2 expression and its effects on the established cell line behavior in vitro and in vivo. Data illustrated that human HER2 protein was expressed on isolated 4T1-HER2 clones in vitro and in vivo. Except for proliferation over 48 hours, such expression did not change 4T1-HER2 characteristics compared to 4T1 in vitro. Notwithstanding the reduction in proliferation, the rate of tumorigenicity was 90% in challenged mice and Herceptin therapy significantly decreased tumors' growth and metastasis compared to the control group. We describe a murine model for HER2-positive breast cancer not only helping shed light on the mechanisms by which the tumor evades antitumor immunity but also playing a key role in making breast cancer more sensitive to novel immunotherapy modalities.",

All patients with a diagnosis of second primary as per International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) definition or those developing a second primary within the study period were included for analysis. Data were recorded in form of preformed questionnaires. All the cases were followed up for at least 12 months. Fifty cases of multiple primary tumors were identified, out of which 21 were synchronous while rest 29 were metachronous type. The male-female ratio was 1:1.2. The median age at presentation for index malignancy was 50 years. The most common malignancy in the synchronous group was a combination of variety of GI cancers (six cases). In the metachronous category, a combination of reproductive cancers (breast, ovary, cervix, and endometrium) along with Gastrointestinal cancer (GI) cancers (colon, rectum) was most frequently found (eight cases). Definite risk factors for multiple primary tumors were identifiable in 10 cases: arsenic exposure in 5 cases, hereditary in 4 cases, and immunosuppression in 1, while in 8 cases, risk factors were only speculative (radiation 5 cases, chemotherapy 3).

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) and its treatment can impair patient quality of life (QoL), and those undergoing more aggressive treatments may be more severely impacted. Objective: Assess the level of perception of the QoL of patients treated for BC at the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas and the Departmental Hospital of Soriano. A questionnaire for cancer patients (EORTC, QLQ-C30) and one specific for BC (EORTC QLQ-BR23) were used. A total of 158 patients who had completed chemotherapy treatment at least one year prior to the evaluation were enrolled. The average age was 61 years old. The global QoL score (GQOL) was high: 70.9. Patients undergoing breast-conservation surgery (BCS) had better scores in physical and emotional functioning (p < 0.005) and presented less frequently with: pain, constipation, and financial difficulties (p < 0.005). Those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had higher scores for GQOL and for physical, role, and social functioning scales (p < 0.001) and had less fatigue, pain, insomnia, and financial difficulties (p < 0.005). Sexual functioning and sexual enjoyment scales were relatively low. Patients undergoing BCS had better scores on the functional scales: body image and future outlook; and fewer breast symptoms (p < 0.005). Those undergoing SLNB also had better scores on the functional scales for body image and future outlook future and presented less frequently with symptoms (p < 0.005). Uruguayan BC patients experience high values on the GQOL scale; those undergoing BCS and SLNB had better scores on most functional and problem/symptom scales. Patients undergoing BCS had better scores in physical and emotional functioning and presented less frequently with pain, constipation, and financial difficulties. With respect to the type of axillary surgery received, patients who underwent SLNB had higher scores on the GQOL scale and on the physical, role, and social functional scales. The implementation of intervention strategies aimed at improving the quality of life, and the physical and emotional care of patients is recommended.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aims to report the increasing incidence of second primary malignancies to better understand the association of multiple primary cancers and the duration of their occurrence. Keeping in view the current trends in dual malignancies and to further emphasize the importance of screening and follow-up diagnosis, we reviewed the records of patients who were diagnosed with dual malignancies. This is a retrospective observational study. We collected data from the hospital database, of patients presenting with either histologically proven synchronous or metachronous double primaries between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021. The time interval to differentiate between synchronous and metachronous has been taken as 6 months. During the period of five years, twenty-three patients presented with dual malignancy. Out of 23 cases, seven were synchronous (30.43%), and 16 were metachronous (69.56%). In the synchronous malignancy group, the most common site of first and second primary malignancy was breast [5 cases (71.4%) and 3 cases (42.8%), respectively]. In the metachronous malignancy group, the most common site of the first primary was breast (7 cases; 43.75%), followed by the head and neck (4 cases; 25%), and the most common site of the second primary was also the breast (6 cases; 37.5%), followed by the lung (5 cases; 31.25%). Second primary malignancies are not rare and can occur at any age. Regular follow-up and screening procedures by the treating oncologist can play a major role in early detection followed by appropriate treatment of second primary tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease of the older population in developed countries where the incidence among the young is rising despite the decline in the overall incidence. Contrary to this, in India, which is a low-incidence country for CRCs, the incidence among all age groups including the young is rising. This study aimed at describing the clinico-demographic profile of young CRC cases and the epidemiological trend of the proportion of young cases from 2014 to 2021 in a tertiary cancer center in Eastern India. This retrospective observational study was conducted at Department of Radiation Oncology, State Cancer Institute, IGIMS Patna, India a prominent tertiary cancer care center of Bihar. All histopathologically confirmed CRC cases in the 0-39 years age group were considered young and evaluated for the clinical, demographic profile as well as yearly trends in proportion out of total CRC cases. Microsoft Excel (2021) was used for statistical analysis. A P value of 0.05 was considered significant. Young colorectal (less than 40 years) patients constituted a third (n = 344, 33.4%) of total colorectal (n = 1028) cases. The median age among the young CRC cases was 30 years (range: 12 to 39 years). Rectum was the most common subsite noted (n = 255,74.1%) among this group of young patients. The most commonly encountered stage of the disease was III (n = 107, 31.1%) and chemotherapy was the most common treatment offered (n = 153, 44.5%). The proportion of young (0-39 years) CRC cases ranged between 29.4 and 37.4 (mean 33.5 \u00b1 2.77, P value = 0.725) over the calendar years of the study period. The proportion of young (<40 years of age) cases out of total CRC cases in our study is higher than that in developed countries. However, the trends of this proportion have been consistent over the study period, i.e., from 2014 to 2021 without any significant change in our hospital-based cancer registry. Rectal cancer affected nearly three out of every four CRC patients in this age group. More advanced disease at presentation emphasizes the need for measures of screening, early diagnosis, and adequate infrastructure for treatment.",

Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a zinc finger transcription factor originally isolated from subtraction library of human insulinoma. The main aim was to study the INSM1 expression in a spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors and a limited spectrum of nonneuroendocrine tumors. A total of 100 cases of which 57 neuroendocrine neoplasms and 43 nonneuroendocrine neoplasms were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done and expression patterns of INSM1 were analyzed. Pituitary adenoma, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, pheochromocytoma lung, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were the neuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. Papillary carcinoma of thyroid, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were the nonneuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. Depending upon the tissue availability, comparison of INSM1 with synaptophysin and chromogranin was also done in few neuroendocrine tumors. All the 57 neuroendocrine tumors showed positive expression for INSM1 and all the nonneuroendocrine tumors were negative for INSM1. This study is statistically significant. Our study suggests that INSM1 is a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors with high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The study is significant and suggests that INSM1- IHC shows nuclear positivity in a spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors. Being a nuclear marker, interpretation is easy and more reliable than the cytoplasmic markers. INSM1 has a stronger positivity than synaptophysin and chromogranin in the present study especially for small cell carcinoma lung. Hence, INSM1 may be included in the routine panel for neuroendocrine tumors along with synaptophysin and chromogranin.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate interpretation of post-treatment imaging in head and neck malignancies poses a challenge due to treatment sequelae. Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion helps in this scenario by evaluating the hemodynamic characteristics of lesions. This study aimed to elucidate the diagnostic efficacy of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MR perfusion imaging in detecting recurrence in patients after they underwent definitive treatment for head and neck tumors. Thirty patients who had received definitive curative-intent treatment for histopathology-proven malignant head and neck tumors and in whom recurrent tumor was detected on precontrast MR imaging (MRI) were accrued in the study. Patients underwent DCE-MR perfusion imaging. Time to peak (TTP), relative maximum enhancement (RME), and relative washout (RWO) ratio were calculated by using time-intensity curve (TIC). The diagnostic accuracy was compared with histopathology. A cut-off value of \u2265125.3 for RME showed a sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 66.7% for differentiating post-radiation changes and recurrence. The optimal cut-off for RWO ratio was \u2265-6.24 with a sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 55.6%. The optimal cut-off of TTP was \u226445.8 s with a sensitivity of 61.9% and specificity of 77.8%. Diagnostic accuracies of RME, RWO, and TTP were 73.3%, 70%, and 66.7%, respectively. DCE-MRI had significant diagnostic accuracy in detecting and differentiating recurrences. TIC analysis of high-temporal resolution DCE-MRI can provide information regarding microcirculation of tumors, and hence can be considered as an imaging modality of choice for assessment of early local tumor recurrence in head and neck tumors.",

Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), a biomarker, is known to be altered in oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and oral leukoplakia (OL). Therefore, we evaluated and compared the serum and salivary IL-1\u03b2 levels in patients with OSMF/oral leukoplakia and in gender- and age-matched healthy individuals. An in vivo, prospective, observational study was conducted on 40 subjects. Subjects were divided into two groups with 20 individuals in each group, that is, Group I: OSMF/oral leukoplakia and Group II: control group. Salivary and serum IL-1\u03b2 levels were quantitatively estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The statistical tests used were unpaired t-test and Chi-square test. The serum IL-1\u03b2 levels were significantly (P 0.001) lesser in Group I in comparison to Group II. The salivary IL-1\u03b2 levels remained insignificant between both the groups. However, in both the groups, the salivary IL-1\u03b2 levels were significantly higher compared to the serum IL-1\u03b2 levels. We found that the serum IL-1\u03b2 level can be considered as a prospective biomarker for dysplasia, whereas salivary IL-1\u03b2 alone needs more elaborated studies to account for its application as a potential biomarker in OPMD.",

Human placental extract is one option that has been proposed. This study aimed at evaluating the therapeutic benefits of human placental extract (Placentrex) in the management of radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients on curative intent treatment for head and neck cancers with concurrent chemoradiation, and to compare the observations with other conventional approaches. Patients presenting to the Department of Radiation Oncology, of a tertiary cancer care center, with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx, planned for definitive, curative intent chemoradiation, between January 2020 and June 2021, were recruited for this study. The interventional group received a deep intramuscular injection of 2 ml of Placentrex to the deltoid muscle, once-a-day from the 11th fraction of radiation till completion, on treatment and non-treatment days. The control group received supportive, symptomatic, conventional treatments for mucositis. The response was assessed every week during treatment and at the third and sixth months of follow-up and was compared. The study comprised 26 patients, 15 in the interventional group and 11 in the control group. On completion of treatment, 40% in the interventional arm and 81.82% in the control arm had progressed to grade 2 and 3 mucositis (P < 0.05). Treatment interruption was seen in 13% in the interventional arm and 55% in the control arm (P < 0.001). Results from this study show that human placental extract, injection Placentrex, had a significant effect in decreasing the severity of radiation-induced mucositis and thereby reducing any interruption or delay in treatment when compared to other conventional methods.",

The role of CX3CL1 has been studied in tumors of the breast, lung, colon, pancreas, prostate, etc. The current study was undertaken to understand the importance of CX3CL1 and its correlation with CD57+ cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Seventy-five primary OSCC were staged and histopathologically graded, followed by immunohistochemistry for CX3CL1 and CD57. Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Post hoc Bonferroni test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were applied. CX3CL1 assessment within the tumor cells was high in 62.66% of cases, and the CD57 Labeling Index (LI) varied over a wide range of 8.2-111.6. A statistically significant reduction in expression of both CX3CL1 and CD57 was observed with an increase in histologic grade (p = 0.021 and 0.038, respectively). It is concluded that CX3CL1 and CD57 may be important players in the immune surveillance of OSCC. Further studies with detailed follow-up for the overall survival of patients will help in studying the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic roles of CX3CL1 in OSCC.",

The multi-leaf collimators on the varian linear accelerator move on a carriage with a maximum leaf span of 15 cm. Therefore, treatment of larger planning target volumes, such as in nasopharyngeal cancer with traditional open and limited jaw technique, yields compromised dose distribution. Computed tomography data sets of 10 nasopharynx cancer patients were enrolled for the study. For each case, three separate treatment plans were generated viz. open, limited, and split x-jaw planning techniques with similar planning objectives. Only PTVs requiring a field size larger than 18 cm in the x-jaw position were considered. Comparable results were obtained regarding organs at risk (OAR) sparing in all the techniques. The target dose coverage with split x-jaw VMAT was superior to both open and limited jaw planning techniques, with a statistically significant difference in the intermediate dose planning target volumes (PTVs) (PTV59.4), P < 0.05. However, the split technique's dose to the spinal cord and larynx was significantly lower (P < 0.05). The split x-jaw planning technique of VMAT can be adapted for larger PTVs requiring an x-jaw of more than 15 cm. The only concern with this technique is the increased MU.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary cancer that poorly responds to treatment. Molecular cancer studies led to the development of kinase inhibitors, among which sorafenib stands out as a multi-kinase inhibitor approved by FDA for first line use in HCC patients. However, the efficiency of sorafenib was shown to be counteracted by numerous subcellular pathways involving the effector kinase AKT, causing resistance and limiting its survival benefit. On the way of breaking such resistance mechanisms and increase the efficiency of sorafenib, deeper understanding of hepatocellular physiology is essential. Thyroid hormones were shown to be metabolized in liver and inevitably affect the molecular behaviour of hepatocytes. Interestingly, thyroid hormone T3 was also demonstrated to be potentially influential in liver regeneration and treatment with this hormone reportedly led to a decrease in HCC tumor growths. In this study, we aimed to uncover the impact of T3 hormone on the cytotoxic response to sorafenib in HCC in vitro. We pre-treated the HCC cell line Huh-7 with T3 prior to sorafenib exposure both in 2D and 3D culture. We checked cell viability with MTT assay in 2D culture and measured the sizes of 3D spheroids with bright-field microscopy followed by a surface analysis with ImageJ. We also performed scratch assay to measure cell migration as well as western blot and qPCR to uncover affected pathways. We observed an additive effect to sorafenib's cytotoxicity both in 2D and 3D culture. Cell migration assay also confirmed our finding and pointed out a benefit of T3 hormone in HCC cell migration. Western blot experiments showed that T3 exerts its additive effect by suppressing AKT expression upon sorafenib treatment both at protein and gene expression levels. Our results open a promising new avenue in increasing sorafenib's cytotoxicity where thyroid hormone T3 is utilized to modulate AKT expression to combat resistance, and warrant further studies in the field.",

An analysis of the properties and applications of quantum dots in noninvasive detection of oral squamous cell cancer is presented in this study, which comprehensively explores the available evidence. Following searches in the databases PubMed, Ovid SP, and Cochrane using the search terms quantum dots AND oral squamous cell cancer, 55 published publications were chosen for this review. The review identified a total of eight papers that met the criteria. In noninvasive detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma, quantum dots have the potential to offer an array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Furthermore, quantum dots emit near-infrared and visible light, which is advantageous in biological imaging since it reduces light dispersion and absorption of tissue. The future may see quantum dots become a popular noninvasive imaging technique for oral squamous cell cancer. The number of studies accessible is quite limited, and further research is required.",

Seventy patients with head and neck cancer underwent follow-up contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT examinations. All datasets were reconstructed using FBP, hybrid IR with 30 % adaptive statistical IR (ASiR-V), and DLIR with three selectable levels (low, medium, and high) at 2.5- and 0.625-mm slice thicknesses. Herein, signal, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio of lymph nodes and overall image quality, artifact, and noise of selected regions of interest were evaluated by two radiologists. Next, cervical lymph node sharpness was evaluated using full width at half maximum. DLIR exhibited significantly reduced noise, ranging from 3.8 % to 35.9 % with improved signal-to-noise ratio (11.5-105.6 %) and contrast-to-noise ratio (10.5-107.5 %) compared with FBP and ASiR-V, for cervical lymph nodes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further, 0.625-mm-thick images reconstructed using DLIR-medium and DLIR-high had a lower noise than 2.5-mm-thick images reconstructed using FBP and ASiR-V. The lymph node margins and vessels on DLIR-medium and DLIR-high were sharper than those on FBP and ASiR-V (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both readers agreed that DLIR had a better image quality than the conventional reconstruction algorithms. DLIR-medium and -high provided superior cervical lymph node image quality in head and neck CT. Improved image quality affords thin-slice DLIR images for dose-reduction protocols in the future.",

Therefore, our aim was to evaluate how colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis and management was affected during the first year of pandemics in Portugal. This is a Portuguese substudy of the French retrospective multicentric study ETICC (Etude de l'Impact de la pand\u00e9mie COVID-19 sur le diagnostic et la prise en charge du Cancer Colorectal). We compared patients' characteristics, clinical manifestations, CRC staging at diagnosis, delay to first medical appointment, histological diagnosis, surgical and medical treatments between the year previous to the pandemics (control) and the first year of pandemics. We included 766 patients: 496 in the control group and 270 in the COVID group. There was no significant difference in CRC staging at diagnosis between both groups, with 21% being diagnosed as metastatic in the control group and 22% in the first year of pandemics (p = 0.770). Contrary to what happened in France, there was a significant decrease in CRC diagnosis in asymptomatic patients (25-8.4%; p < 0.001) and after a positive fecal immunochemical test (20.8-11.3%; p = 0.002) during the pandemics. Although the increase in the overall complication rate at diagnosis was nonsignificant, in Portugal, there was a significant increase in diagnosis of abdominal occlusion (12.1-18.1%; p = 0.033). In Portugal, time between the beginning of symptoms and the first medical appointment significantly increased from a median of 50 days to 64 days during COVID (p < 0.001). On the contrary, time between histological diagnosis and tumor resection had significantly decreased from a median of 65 to 39 days (p < 0.001). Time between histological diagnosis and neoadjuvant treatment was not statistically different (median of 64-67 days; p = 0.590), as was time between histological diagnosis and palliative chemotherapy (median of 50-51 days; p = 1.000). Time from CRC resection and adjuvant treatment has significantly decreased from a median of 54 to 43 days (p = 0.001). We found a significant impact in CRC diagnosis in the first year of pandemics, more pronounced than what was found in France. These are likely related not only with the closing of endoscopy units but also with the difficulties patients had in finding an appointment with their general practitioners. On the other hand, both in France and Portugal, the first year of pandemics did not worsen CRC staging at diagnosis and did not significantly affect medical and surgical treatments once the diagnosis was made.

Furthermore, EUS nowadays has evolved from a purely diagnostic modality to allow the performance of minimally invasive locoregional therapy for pancreatic focal lesions. The choice of treatment as well as the treatment goals depend on several factors, including tumor secretory status, grading, staging, and patient performance status. Surgery has been the mainstay for the management of these patients, particularly for localized, low-grade, large panNETs >2 cm. Over the last decade, a significant body of evidence has been accumulated evaluating the role of EUS for the ablative therapy of panNETs, namely by the use of chemoablative agents and radiofrequency. Although endoscopic techniques are not routinely recommended by international guidelines, they may be considered for the treatment of smaller lesions in patients who are unwilling or unfit for pancreatic surgery. In this review, we summarize the existing evidence on the interventional techniques for the treatment of patients with panNETs, focusing on the EUS-guided and surgical approaches. Os tumores neuroend\u00f3crinos do p\u00e2ncreas (panNETs) s\u00e3o um grupo de neoplasias com comportamento biol\u00f3gico e cl\u00ednico heterog\u00e9neo. Embora historicamente considerados raros, a incid\u00eancia desses tumores tem aumentado, algo que se atribui principalmente \u00e0 melhoria na dete\u00e7\u00e3o de pequenos tumores assintom\u00e1ticos em exames de imagem. A heterogeneidade destas les\u00f5es cria desafios significativos no que respeita ao seu diagn\u00f3stico, estadiamento e tratamento. A ultrassonografia endosc\u00f3pica melhorou a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das les\u00f5es pancre\u00e1ticas. Concomitantemente, a ultrassonografia endosc\u00f3pica, para al\u00e9m da vertente diagn\u00f3stica, evoluiu no sentido do desenvolvimento de capacidades terap\u00eauticas, permitindo a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de terap\u00eautica locorregional de les\u00f5es pancre\u00e1ticas focais de forma minimamente invasiva.A sele\u00e7\u00e3o do tratamento, bem como a defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus objetivos, depende de diversos fatores, incluindo a atividade secretora da neoplasia, a sua atividade mit\u00f3tica, o estadiamento e o status funcional do doente. A cirurgia \u00e9 considerada a pedra basilar do tratamento destes doentes, particularmente para panNETs localizados, de baixo grau, com >2 cm. Ao longo da \u00faltima d\u00e9cada foi gerado um conjunto significativo de evid\u00eancia relativamente ao papel da ultrassonografia endosc\u00f3pica na terap\u00eautica ablativa dos panNETs, nomeadamente atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de agentes quimioablativos e de radiofrequ\u00eancia.

        "AbstractText": "Gastric neuroendocrine tumors (GNETs) frequently have an indolent clinical course, despite their metastatic potential. The aim of the study was to identify prognostic factors associated with overall survival and risk of metastases and to evaluate the impact of serial measurements of chromogranin A (CgA). The authors performed a retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with GNET diagnosed between 2010 and 2019, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. We included 132 patients with GNET (type I, 113 patients; type II, 1 patient; type III, 14 patients; type IV, 2 patients; not classifiable, 2 patients), with 61% being female and a mean age at diagnosis of 66 years. During the follow-up period (median 66 months), 3 (2.3%) patients died due to metastatic disease (1 patient with type III and 2 patients with type IV). Male gender (p = 0.030), type III/IV (p < 0.001), Ki-67 index >20% (p < 0.001), grade 2/3 (p < 0.001), invasion beyond the submucosa (p < 0.001), and presence of metastases (p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors for mortality in the univariate analysis. Metastasis developed in 7 patients (5.3%). Multivariable analysis revealed that Ki-67 >20% (p = 0.016) was an independent risk factor for metastasis. Overall, CgA showed a sensitivity of 20% for detection of recurrence and a specificity of 79% (sensitivity of 8% and specificity of 71% in type I GNETs). Identification of risk factors for the presence of metastases and for mortality in these groups of patients can help in individualizing the therapeutic strategy. CgA seems to be a weak marker for monitoring patients with GNET.

The role of PDCD2 in solid cancers (excluding hematopoietic malignancies) and their diagnosis and prognosis remains unclear. The TCGA, CGGA, GEPIA, cBioPortal, and GTEx databases were analyzed for expression, prognostic value, and genetic modifications of PDCD2 in cancer patients. Functional enrichment analysis, CCK8, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and xenograft tumor model were undertaken to study the PDCD2's biological function in glioma (GBMLGG). The PDCD2 gene was associated with solid cancer progression. In the functional enrichment analysis results, PDCD2 was shown to participate in several important GBMLGG biological processes. GBMLGG cells may be inhibited in their proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumor growth by knocking down PDCD2. Our research can provide new insights into solid cancer prognostic biomarkers of PDCD2.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging is a contributor to liver disease. Hence, the concept of liver aging has become prominent and has attracted considerable interest, but its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In our study, the internal mechanism of liver aging was explored via multi-omics analysis and molecular experiments to support future targeted therapy. An aged rat liver model was established with d-galactose, and two other senescent hepatocyte models were established by treating HepG2 cells with d-galactose and H2O2. We then performed transcriptomic and metabolomic assays of the aged liver model and transcriptome analyses of the senescent hepatocyte models. In livers, genes related to peroxisomes, fatty acid elongation, and fatty acid degradation exhibited down-regulated expression with aging, and the hepatokine Fgf21 expression was positively correlated with the down-regulation of these genes. In senescent hepatocytes, similar to the results found in aged livers, FGF21 expression was also decreased. Moreover, the expressions of cell cycle-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and the down-regulated gene E2F8 was the key cell cycle-regulating transcription factor. We then validated that FGF21 overexpression can protect against liver aging and that FGF21 can attenuate the declines in the antioxidant and regenerative capacities in the aging liver. We successfully validated the results from cellular and animal experiments using human liver and blood samples. Our study indicated that FGF21 is an important target for inhibiting liver aging and suggested that pharmacological prevention of the reduction in FGF21 expression due to aging may be used to treat liver aging-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Transcriptional factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) plays an important role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying its dysregulation remain unclear. We identified and functionally validated the microRNAs (miRNAs) that critically regulate FOXM1 expression in PDAC. The expression levels of miRNA-23a (miR-23a-3p and -5p) were altered in PDAC cell lines and their effects on FOXM1 signaling and cell proliferation and migration and tumorigenesis were examined in vitro and in vivo using mouse PDAC models. Compared with non-tumor pancreatic tissues, PDAC tissues and cell lines exhibited significantly reduced levels of miR-23a expression. Reduced miR-23a expression and concomitant increase in FOXM1 expression were also observed in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, the major premalignant lesions of PDAC. Transgenic expression of miR-23a reduced the expression of FOXM1 and suppressed cell proliferation and migration in PDAC cells, whereas the inhibitors of miR-23a did the opposite. Loss or reduced levels of miR-23a increased the levels of FOXM1 expression, while increased expression of FOXM1 down-regulated miR-23a expression, suggesting that miR-23a and FOXM1 were mutual negative regulators of their expression in PDAC cells. Therefore, the miR-23a/FOXM1 signaling axis is important in PDAC initiation and progression and could serve as an interventional or therapeutic target for patients with early or late stages of PDAC.",

However, the discrepancy in the efficacy of ICIs in HCC patients with distinct etiologies has not been systematically validated. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and abstracts from ASCO and ESMO conferences were searched for eligible trials that explored the impact of etiology factor on the ICI treatment in HCC patients. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), as well as the pooled odds ratio (OR) of objective response rate (ORR), were calculated with stratification of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and nonviral subgroup, and the heterogeneity between different etiological subgroups was assessed by using an interaction test. Eight eligible studies with a total of 5,646 patients were identified from searching published articles and conference abstracts. ICI therapies were associated with significantly prolonged OS with the pooled HRs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.84, p < 0.001), 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.79, p < 0.001), 0.80 (95% CI 0.69-0.93, p = 0.003), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.97, p = 0.011) for the whole population, HBV subgroup, HCV subgroup, and non-viral subgroup, respectively.

Our study compares the mortality in hospitalized VTE patients among the four most common gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies which include esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer. A retrospective study was conducted utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (NIS) from 2016 to 2019. Patients with VTE were identified using ICD-10 codes from all primary discharge diagnoses. Only deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were considered. Patients with VTE were further divided into groups: esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, and compared with patients who did not have these malignancies. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was calculated using multivariate regression analysis. Among 999,559 patients discharged with a VTE diagnosis, 25,775 (2.6%) had one of the four GI malignancies. Among patients with one of the four included GI malignancy diagnosis, 18,816 (73%) patients had PE and 6,959 (27%) patients had DVT. The study shows that adults admitted to the hospitals for VTE have higher mortality when compared to patients who did not have GI malignancies, with esophageal cancer having the highest inpatient mortality with an aOR of 2.701; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.989-3.669, p value <0.000. For the remaining GI cancers, gastric cancer had an aOR 1.576; CI: 1.094-2.269, p value 0.015, and pancreatic cancer had an aOR of 1.736; 95% CI: 1.445-2.085, p value <0.000. Patients with colorectal cancer had no significant increase in the odds of mortality with aOR of 1.213; 95% CI: 0.988-1.489, p value 0.066.

Such methods as transanal excision, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and transanal minimally invasive surgery can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for these procedures, and proper diagnostics are necessary to establish indications. Compared to total mesorectal excision, transanal excision techniques have been shown to have fewer complications and comorbidities while still being able to remove cancerous tissue entirely. Transanal excision is the simplest method, where the operator removes visible rectal lesions. The basic principle of transanal endoscopic microsurgery is to dilate the rectum mechanically and by air insufflation and then use special surgical instruments to remove suspicious lesions under the vision of a telescope. Transanal minimally invasive surgery combines transanal endoscopic microsurgery and single-incision laparoscopic surgery, making the hard-to-reach proximal rectum accessible to classic laparoscopic instruments. Local excision techniques, when used as a monotherapy for treating patients with rectal cancer, have established themselves as a curative and less radical treatment for strictly selected patients with early rectal carcinoma, leading to improved quality of life. When combined with other modalities such as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, total neoadjuvant therapy, and immunotherapy, transanal surgery can be offered to patients with locally advanced rectal cancer as part of the organ preservation strategy. This review will discuss the patient selection and technical aspects of transanal surgery, showcasing its current role in treating rectal carcinoma.",

Patient details were obtained from case files. The graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy) with Mycophenolate-mofetil and Cyclosporine/tacrolimus/sirolimus. All patients were transfused peripheral blood stem cells from donors. Post-transplant, patients continued regular follow up as per schedule. Supportive care was given as per unit protocol. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Fifty patients underwent haploSCT.

The infants clustered into four groups based on immune cell composition: clusters 1 and 2 showed a high relative abundance of na\u00efve cells, cluster 3 exhibited increased abundance of classical- and non-classical monocytes and clusters 3 and 4 had elevated neutrophil levels. At all age groups, we did observe significant associations between the gut microbiota and immune cell clusters; however, these were generally from low abundant species. Only at 6\u2009months of age we observed significant associations between abundant (>8%) species and immune cell clusters. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Porphyromonadaceae are associated with cluster 1, while Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium longum are associated with clusters 3 and 4 respectively. These species have been linked to T-cell polarization and maturation. No significant correlations were found between short-chain fatty acids and immune cell composition. Our findings suggest that abundant gut bacteria at 6\u2009months may influence immune cell frequencies at 12\u2009months, highlighting the potential role of gut microbiota in shaping later immune cell composition.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy has emerged as a novel immunotherapy method. It has shown significant therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of haematological B cell malignancies. In particular, the CAR-T therapy targeting CD19 has yielded unprecedented efficacy for acute B-lymphocytic leukaemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In haematologic malignancies, tumour stem cells are more prone to stay in the regulatory bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (called niches), which provides a protective environment against immune attack. However, how the BM microenvironment affects the anti-tumour efficacy of CAR-T cells and its underlying mechanism is worthy of attention. In this review, we discuss the role of the BM microenvironment on the efficacy of CAR-T in haematological malignancies and propose corresponding strategies to enhance the anti-tumour activity of CAR-T therapy.",

We compared the initial reports by extramural radiologists and an in-house radiologist specialized in orbital imaging to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of orbital imaging. This was a retrospective chart review of forty patients referred to a Tertiary Eye Care Center in South India over a period of 7 years. These patients already had their imaging done elsewhere. The imaging was re-evaluated by an in-house radiologist. The radiological findings were correlated with the histopathological diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy between the two radiologists was compared. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value in differentiating malignant from benign lesions were calculated in both groups. The sensitivity and PPV of the radiological diagnosis for neoplastic and inflammatory lesions in both groups were analyzed. The accuracy in differentiating malignant from benign and inflammatory lesions by our in-house radiologist and extramural radiologists was 95% (\u03ba = 0.9 [0.764, 0.997]) and 50% (\u03ba = 0.036 [-0.160, 0.232]), respectively. The sensitivity and PPV of the radiological diagnosis by our in-house radiologist were 93.31% and 100% for benign lesions and 95.24% and 95.24% for malignant lesions. On the contrary, reports from the extramural radiologists showed a sensitivity and PPV of 76.92% and 66.67% for benign lesions and 14.28% and 60% for malignant lesions.

        "AbstractText": "Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) remains the most prevailing unfavorable influence and may affect its clinical usage. This study sought to explore the possible impacts of curcumin on preventing CIN in human subjects. The investigation was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted on 82 patients receiving nano-curcumin (80 mg twice daily for five days) or an identical placebo with standard nephroprotective modalities against CIN. Data was gathered on patients' demographics, blood, urinary nitrogen, creatinine (Cr) levels, urinary electrolytes, and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in treatment and placebo groups, 24 h and five days after initiating the administration of cisplatin. Both investigation groups were alike considering the demographic characteristics and clinical baseline data. Curcumin administration led to a significant improvement in blood-urine nitrogen (BUN). BUN, Cr, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the ratio of NGAL-to-Cr considerably altered during the follow-up periods. However, the further alterations in other indices, including urinary sodium, potassium, magnesium, NGAL values, and potassium-to-Cr ratio were not statistically noteworthy. The significant differences in the NGAL-to-Cr ratio between the two groups may indicate the potential protective impact of curcumin supplementation against tubular toxicity. Curcumin management was safe and well-accepted; only insignificant gastrointestinal side effects were reported. Curcumin supplementation may have the potential to alleviate CIN and urinary electrolyte wasting in cancer patients. Future research investigating the effects of a longer duration of follow-up, a larger participant pool, and a higher dosage of curcumin are recommended.",

It was reported that BCSCs contain lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with stemness capability. Caesalpinia sappan has been proposed for its chemopreventive potency against several cancer cells. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Caesalpinia sappan extract (CSE) on cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, ROS generation, and stemness markers of MDA-MB-231 and its BCSCs. Caesalpinia sappan was extracted under maceration with methanol. Magnetic-activated cell sorting was used to isolate BCSCs based on CD44+ and CD24- cell surface expression. The MTT test was used to assess the cytotoxic effects of CSE on MDA-MB-231 and BCSCs. Moreover, flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, ROS level, and CD44/CD24 level. Using qRT-PCR, the gene expression of the stemness markers NANOG, SOX-2, OCT-4, and c-MYC was assessed. We found that MDA-MB-231 contains 80% of the BCSCs population, and CSE showed more potent cytotoxicity toward BCSCs than MDA-MB-231. CSE caused apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and BCSCs cells by increasing the level of ROS. Furthermore, CSE significantly reduced the MDA-MB-231 stemness marker CD44+/CD24- and the mRNA levels of pluripotent markers of cells in BCSCs. CSE potentially reduces BCSCs stemness, which may be mediated by the elevation of the ROS levels and reduction of the expression levels of stemness transcription.",

Many reports propose gallic acid as a candidate for cancer treatment due to its biological and medicinal effects as well as its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the effects of metformin and gallic acid on human breast cancer (MCF-7) and normal (MCF-10) cell lines. MCF7 and MCF-10 cells were treated with various concentrations of metformin, gallic acid, and their combination. Cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as cell cycle arrest were measured. Autophagy induction was assessed using western blot analysis. Metformin and gallic acid did not cause toxicity in normal cells. They had a stronger combined impact on ROS induction. Metformin and Gallic acid resulted in cell cycle arrest in the sub-G1 phase with G1 and S phase arrest, respectively. Increased levels of LC3 and Beclin-1 markers along with decreased P62 markers were observed in cancerous cells, which is consistent with the anticancer properties of metformin and gallic acid. The effects of metformin and gallic acid on cancerous cells indicate the positive impact of their combination in treating human breast cancer.",

In this study, two new variants of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), designated EG3-1 and EG3-2, were designed to increase their affinity for HER2 receptors. To this end, DARPin G3 was selected as a template, and six-point mutations comprising Q26E, I32V, T49A, L53H, K101R, and G124V were created on its structure. Furthermore, the 3D structures were formed through homology modeling and evaluated using molecular dynamic simulation. Then, both structures were docked to the HER2 receptor using the HADDOCK web tool, followed by 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulation for both DARPins / HER2 complexes. The theoretical result confirmed both structures' stability. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the applied mutations on DARPin EG3-2 significantly improve the receptor binding affinity of DARPin. The computationally engineered DARPin EG3-2 in this study could provide a hit compound for the design of promising anticancer agents targeting HER2 receptors.",

Specifically, the copper smelting process releases arsenic, a semi-volatile metalloid, which poses an emerging exposure risk to both workers and nearby residents. To comprehensively understand the internal exposure risks of metal(loid)s from copper smelting, we explored eighteen metal(loid)s and arsenic metabolites in the urine of both occupational and non-occupational populations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with high-performance liquid chromatography and compared their health risks. Results showed that zinc and copper (485.38 and 14.00 \u00b5g/L), and arsenic, lead, cadmium, vanadium, tin and antimony (46.80, 6.82, 2.17, 0.40, 0.44 and 0.23 \u00b5g/L, respectively) in workers (n=179) were significantly higher compared to controls (n=168), while Zinc, tin and antimony (412.10, 0.51 and 0.15 \u00b5g/L, respectively) of residents were significantly higher than controls. Additionally, workers had a higher monomethyl arsenic percentage (MMA%), showing lower arsenic methylation capacity. Source appointment analysis identified arsenic, lead, cadmium, antimony, tin and thallium as co-exposure metal(loid)s from copper smelting, positively relating to the age of workers. The hazard index (HI) of workers exceeded 1.0, while residents and control were approximately at 1.0. Besides, all three populations had accumulated cancer risks exceeding 1.0 \u00d7 10-4, and arsenite (AsIII) was the main contributor to the variation of workers and residents. Furthermore, residents living closer to the smelting plant had higher health risks. This study reveals arsenic exposure metabolites and multiple metals as emerging contaminants for copper smelting exposure populations, providing valuable insights for pollution control in non-ferrous metal smelting.",

There is increasing evidence that exposure to EDCs can have profound adverse effects on reproduction, metabolic disorders, neurological alterations, and increased risk of hormone-dependent cancer. Stem cells (SCs) are integral to these pathological processes, and it is therefore crucial to understand how EDCs may influence SC functionality. This review examines the literature on different types of EDCs and their effects on various types of SCs, including embryonic, adult, and cancer SCs. Possible molecular mechanisms through which EDCs may influence the phenotype of SCs are also evaluated. Finally, the possible implications of these effects on human health are discussed. The available literature demonstrates that EDCs can influence the biology of SCs in a variety of ways, including by altering hormonal pathways, DNA damage, epigenetic changes, reactive oxygen species production and alterations in the gene expression patterns. These disruptions may lead to a variety of cell fates and diseases later in adulthood including increased risk of endocrine disorders, obesity, infertility, reproductive abnormalities, and cancer. Therefore, the review emphasizes the importance of raising broader awareness regarding the intricate impact of EDCs on human health.",

As additional target proteins for prenylation were identified in the past, it is likely that FTI have potential value for therapeutic purposes beyond cancer. The effect of FTI on B-cells remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of in vitro FTI treatment on effector and regulatory B-cells in healthy controls and renal transplant patients. For this purpose, B-cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy controls and renal transplant patients. Purified B-cells were stimulated via Toll-like-receptor 9 (TLR-9) in the presence or absence of FTI. Regulatory functions, such as IL-10 and Granzyme B (GrB) secretion, were assessed by flow cytometry. In addition, effector B-cell functions, such as plasma cell formation and IgG secretion, were studied. The two FTI Lonafarnib and tipifarnib both suppressed TLR-9-induced B-cell proliferation. Maturation of IL-10 producing B-cells was suppressed by FTI at high concentrations as well as induction of GrB-secreting B-cells. Plasma blast formation and IgG secretion were potently suppressed by FTI. Moreover, purified B-cells from immunosuppressed renal transplant patients were also susceptible to FTI-induced suppression of effector functions, evidenced by diminished IgG secretion. FTI suppress in vitro B-cell proliferation and plasma cell formation while partially preserving IL-10 as well as GrB production of B-cells. Thus, FTI may have immunosuppressive capacity encouraging further studies to investigate the potential immunomodulatory value of this agent.",

The activity and rate of allograft rejection in SOT recipients with advanced skin cancers treated with ICI is understudied. We conducted a retrospective analysis of SOT recipients with advanced melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) who were treated with ICI. Unpublished cases from our institution and published cases from the literature were aggregated. Demographics, type of immunosuppressive therapy, type of ICI(s) administered, prior systemic therapies, tumor response to ICI, and evidence of organ rejection and/or failure were recorded. Objective response rates (ORR) and rates of graft rejection and failure are reported. Ninety patients were identified; four patients from our institution and 86 unique patients from a literature review. ORR to first-line ICI for the entire cohort was 41.1% (37/90). ORR by tumor type was 31% (18/58), 64.3% (18/28), and 25.0% (1/4) for melanoma, cSCC, and MCC, respectively. The rate of graft rejection was 37.8% (34/90) with 61.8% (21/34) of these cases progressing to graft failure. Number of immunosuppressive agents (0, 1, 2, or 3) was inversely associated with rate of graft failure. In this retrospective analysis, ICIs demonstrate clinical activity in SOT recipients with cutaneous malignancies; however, the rate of graft rejection is high. Treatment plans should be individualized through thorough interdisciplinary discussion. Immunosuppressive modifications may be considered prior to starting treatment, but when feasible, enrollment on clinical trials is preferred.",

        "AbstractText": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare but life-threatening malignancy that arises in the setting of immunosuppression (IS) after solid organ transplant. IS regimens containing belatacept have been associated with an increased risk of PTLD in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative renal transplant recipients, and the use of belatacept is contraindicated in this population. However, the impact of belatacept-based regimens on PTLD risk and outcomes in EBV-seropositive renal transplant recipients is less well characterized. A case-control study was conducted to investigate how combinatorial IS regimens impact the risk of PTLD and survival outcomes in renal transplant recipients at a large transplant center between 2010 and 2019. In total, 17 cases of PTLD were identified and matched 1:2 to controls without PTLD by age, sex, and transplanted organ(s). We compared baseline clinical characteristics, examined changes in IS regimen, viral loads, and renal function over time, and evaluated time-to-event analyses, including graft rejection and survival. Cases of PTLD largely resembled matched controls in terms of baseline characteristics, although expected differences in EBV serostatus trended toward significance (42.9% of PTLD cases were donor-positive/recipient-negative vs. 8.3% controls, p\u2009=\u20090.063). PTLD cases were not more likely to have received belatacept than controls. Belatacept was not associated with graft rejection or failure, re-transplant, hospitalization, or decreased survival. Belatacept was not associated with an increased risk of PTLD, and was not associated with decreased survival in either PTLD cases or in the entire cohort. Our case-control study supports the concept that belatacept remains a safe and effective option for IS in EBV-seropositive renal transplant patients.",

These positive responses to CAR T therapy have spurred biotech and big pharma companies to evaluate innovative production methods to increase patient access while maintaining adequate quality control and profitability. Autologous cellular therapies are, by definition, manufactured as single patient batches, and demand has soared for manufacturing facilities compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The use of a centralized production model is straining finite resources even in developed countries in North America and the European Union, and patient access is not feasible for most of the developing world. The idea of having a more uniform availability of these cell therapy products promoted the concept of point-of-care (POC) manufacturing or decentralized in-house production. While this strategy can potentially decrease the cost of manufacturing, the challenge comes in maintaining the same quality as currently available centrally manufactured products due to the lack of standardized manufacturing techniques amongst institutions. However, academic medical institutions and biotech companies alike have forged ahead innovating and adopting new technologies to launch clinical trials of CAR T products produced exclusively in-house.

Although computed tomography (CT) is often obtained prior to RC, its ability to predict pathologic response is poorly characterized. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of CT in assessing disease burden after NAC. Patients with MIBC having received NAC prior to RC were identified. Pre- and post-NAC CT scans were reviewed by an abdominal radiologist. The correlation between pathologic complete response (PCR) and radiologic complete response (RCR) was determined as the primary aim. As a secondary aim, the correlation between pathologic partial response (PPR) and radiologic partial response (RPR) was determined. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the predictive value of CT in determining disease burden at RC. A total of 141 patients were identified for analysis. PCR and PPR was achieved in 34% and 16% of patients, respectively. The positive predictive value of post-NAC CT was 53.5% for PCR and 28.8% for PPR. The negative predictive value of post-NAC CT was 73.5% for PCR and 46.2% for PPR. There was no significant association between RCR and PCR (OR 1.13, p\u200a=\u200a0.67). Similarly, there was no meaningful association between RPR and PPR, lymph node involvement, or presence of extravesical disease.

We compared epigenetic profiles in monocytes from NMIBC patients with early disease recurrence with those from recurrence-free patients. We conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) on monocytes from seven patients treated with BCG (four with early recurrences and three recurrence-free after one year) to determine genome-wide distribution and abundance of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) prior to and after five weeks of induction therapy. Genome-wide H3K4me3 profiles before or after BCG induction distinguished patients with early recurrences from those remaining recurrence-free. Furthermore, H3K4me3 levels at genes involved in specific pathways were increased in the recurrence-free group. Independent quantification showed increased H3K4me3 levels in elements of the Wnt and AMPK signaling pathways in the recurrence-free group before BCG initiation, while elements of the MAPK showed increased levels after five weeks of induction in the same group. Validation of these genes on an independent cohort of four additional patients that remained recurrence-free after one year and three with early recurrences revealed consistent increases in H3K4me3 levels associated with MAPK pathway genes after five weeks of BCG treatment in the recurrence-free group. Recurrence-free survival following BCG immunotherapy for NMIBC is associated with the accumulation of H3K4me3 at specific gene loci, and could lead to identification of prognostic biomarkers.",

Most patients were men (62.5%), elderly (median age 82), had high Charlson Comorbidity Index score (median 7, range 4-9) and were nonsurgical candidates (80%). Sixty-eight percent had a macroscopically complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and 33 patients (82.5%) received concurrent chemotherapy. Acute (< =3mo) and late (>3mo) toxicities were assessed according to CTCAE v4.0. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median follow up after Hypo-RT was 32 months (95% CI: 28-49 months). Overall rates of acute grade 2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were 40% each, most commonly urinary frequency and diarrhea. Two cases of acute grade 3 GU/GI toxicity occurred.

        "AbstractText": "For decades, immunotherapies have been integral for the treatment and management of bladder cancer, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) transforming patient care in recent years. However, response rates are poor to T cell-targeted ICIs such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibodies, framing a critical need for complementary immunotherapies. Promising strategies involve harnessing the activation potential of natural killer (NK) cells. They quickly exert their antitumor activity via signaling through germline-encoded activating receptors and are rapidly sensitized to new tissue microenvironments via their regulation by polymorphic HLA class I, KIR and NKG2A receptors. In this review, we examined the roles of currently available NK-targeted antitumor treatment strategies such as engineered viral vectors, small-molecule IMiDs, NK agonist antibodies, interleukins, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells, and their potential for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of bladder cancer. Through review of current literature, we summarized our knowledge of NK cells in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies as their roles pertain to novel immunotherapies already being applied to the treatment of bladder cancer or that offer rationale for considering as potential novel immunotherapeutic strategies. NK cells play a critical role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can be exploited to improve T cell-targeted immunotherapies. Emerging evidence suggests that NK cells are a prime target for improving antitumor functions in immunotherapies for the treatment of bladder cancer. Further research into profiling NK cells in settings of immunotherapies for bladder cancer could help identify patients who might maximally benefit from NK cell-targeted immunotherapies and the various approaches for exploiting their antitumor properties.",

Examples include measurements of spine bone mineral density, cancer growth through mammography or biopsy, a progression of defective vision, or assessment of gait in patients with neurological disorders. Practitioners often need to infer the progression of diseases from such sparse observations. A classical tool for analyzing such data is a mixed-effect model where time is treated as both a fixed effect (population progression curve) and a random effect (individual variability). Alternatively, researchers use Gaussian processes or functional data analysis, assuming that observations are drawn from a certain distribution of processes. While these models are flexible, they rely on probabilistic assumptions, require very careful implementation, and tend to be slow in practice. In this study, we propose an alternative elementary framework for analyzing longitudinal data motivated by matrix completion. Our method yields estimates of progression curves by iterative application of the Singular Value Decomposition. Our framework covers multivariate longitudinal data, and regression and can be easily extended to other settings. As it relies on existing tools for matrix algebra, it is efficient and easy to implement. We apply our methods to understand trends of progression of motor impairment in children with Cerebral Palsy. Our model approximates individual progression curves and explains 30% of the variability. Low-rank representation of progression trends enables identification of different progression trends in subtypes of Cerebral Palsy.",

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of RARC compared with open radical cystectomy (ORC). Multiple databases were searched up to May 2022.

We calculated the ethnicity-stratified 5-year age-adjusted incidence rates of BCa using the US SEER database. We performed somatic mutational-signature analyses and compared the APOBEC-related mutational contribution across BCa tumors in patients of different ethnicities. We analyzed the allele frequency distribution of APOBEC3-related rs1014971 in contemporary populations of different ethnicities and in ancient human genomes. We also analyzed the natural selection profiles and ages of the investigated SNPs. We validated the ethnic difference in BCa risk using US SEER data, revealing Caucasians to be at >2-fold greater risk than Asians / Pacific islanders. In contemporary populations, we observed a coherent ethnic distribution in terms not only of the allele frequency of APOBEC3-related rs1014971, but also the mutational contribution of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in BCa tumors. Population genetics and ancient genome analyses further suggested that the diverse ethnic distribution of rs1014971 could be rooted in human evolution. It is possible that APOBEC3-related rs1014971 is involved in the different BCa incidence across ethnic groups, and this difference is potentially derived from human evolution.

Patient and disease characteristics from 2380 patients with UTUC were collected, and finally 738 patients were included in this analysis. The primary outcome of this study was recurrence-free survival. Propensity score matching was performed. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed by stratifying patients according to the treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 738 patients were included in this analysis, and 59 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), including 50 patients who received gemcitabine. A propensity score matching was performed, including 50 patients who received gemcitabine containing treatment and 50 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease recurrence occurred in 34.0% of patients. The recurrence rate in the AC group was 22.0%, which was significantly lower than the non-AC group (46.0%). Kaplan-Meier analyses also showed that AC was associated with a lower likelihood of tumor recurrence (p\u200a=\u200a0.047).

        "AbstractText": "Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the standard adjuvant treatment for intermediate and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) following transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). However, the optimal dose, strain, and schedule of BCG remain unclear. To evaluate the impact of BCG dose reduction on oncological outcomes and toxicity in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Selected studies were analyzed for Meta Analysis using PRISMA criteria. The study focused on disease recurrence, progression, and toxicity. We also compared the oncological outcomes of the different BCG strains. A total of 2963 patients in 13 randomized controlled trials were included. In recurrence analysis, we found a non-significant difference between the full dose and any dose reduction of BCG (RR\u200a=\u200a1.17, [1.06-1.28], I2\u200a=\u200a0%, p\u200a=\u200a0.7). In terms of progression, the difference was also non-statistically significant (RR: 1.12 [0.89 - 1.41], I2\u200a=\u200a0%, p\u200a=\u200a0.93). In the toxicity analysis, there were more local (RR: 0.81 [0.67-0.99] I2\u200a=\u200a76%; p\u200a<\u200a0.01) and systemic (RR: 0.53 [0.34-0.82] I2\u200a=\u200a83%; p\u200a<\u200a0.01) side effects in the full dose group than in the dose reduction group. There were no statistically significant differences in oncological outcomes between the analyzed BCG strains. Dose reduction did not affect the oncological outcomes of patients with NMIBC who received adjuvant therapy with BCG. On the other hand, dose reduction showed a significant trend towards fewer systemic and local side effects. Further studies comparing oncological and toxicity outcomes using different strains are needed.",

        "AbstractText": "With the exception of the FDA-approved valrubicin and pembrolizumab, there are no standard second-line treaments for BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). To provide a systematic review of the novel intravesically administered therapeutic agents for the salvage treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Online search of the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was performed. The endpoints of this review were to evaluate the efficacy of the agents in terms of complete response rates (CR) and durability of CR, overall survival, recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival and to report on their toxicity profile. A search on Clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify ongoing clinical trials. 14 studies were included in this review. The critical clinical need for the development of an effective, safe and durable intravesical drug for the salvage treatment of high-risk NMIBC seems to be met mainly by intravesical gene therapy; in fact, data support the FDA-approved nadofaragene firadenovec as a potentially important therapeutic advancement in this context. Promising results are also being obtained by the combination of N-803/BCG and by innovative drug delivery systems. Considering the plethora of novel intravesical treatments that have completed phase II evaluation, one can reasonably expect that clinicians will soon have at their disposal new agents and treatment options for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In the near future, it will be up to the urologist to identify, for each specific patient, the right agent to use, based on safety, results and cost-effectiveness.",

        "AbstractText": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced NAD+ (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)/reduced NADP+ (NADPH) are essential metabolites involved in multiple metabolic pathways and cellular processes. NAD+ and NADH redox couple plays a vital role in catabolic redox reactions, while NADPH is crucial for cellular anabolism and antioxidant responses. Maintaining NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis is crucial for normal physiological activity and is tightly regulated through various mechanisms, such as biosynthesis, consumption, recycling, and conversion between NAD(H) and NADP(H). The conversions between NAD(H) and NADP(H) are controlled by NAD kinases (NADKs) and NADP(H) phosphatases [specifically, metazoan SpoT homolog-1 (MESH1) and nocturnin (NOCT)]. NADKs facilitate the synthesis of NADP+ from NAD+, while MESH1 and NOCT convert NADP(H) into NAD(H). In this review, we summarize the physiological roles of NAD(H) and NADP(H) and discuss the regulatory mechanisms governing NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis in three key aspects: the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of NADKs, the role of MESH1 and NOCT in maintaining NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis, and the influence of the circadian clock on NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis. In conclusion, NADKs, MESH1, and NOCT are integral to various cellular processes, regulating NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis. Dysregulation of these enzymes results in various human diseases, such as cancers and metabolic disorders. Hence, strategies aiming to restore NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis hold promise as novel therapeutic approaches for these diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "During pregnancy, many patients may experience changes in the size or characteristics of pigmented lesions including common and dysplastic nevi. These changes can be a cause for concern for the patient and their physician due to the potential for melanoma. Over the past several decades conflicting data has been reported about the relationship between pregnancy and the peripartum period and melanocytic nevi/melanoma. Although recent evidence suggests that prognosis is not worse among pregnant patients who develop melanoma, the discovery of several distinct types of estrogen receptors present in skin and effects of other hormones on melanoma suggest possible mechanisms through which melanocytic lesions may evolve. Many observations among patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome and those without this diagnosis can provide some evidence for how and why melanocytic lesions may change during pregnancy and provide support for clinical decisions in managing such concerns. Here we describe the case of a 27-year-old female who presented to the clinic with concerns of two moles which evolved and grew in diameter during two successive pregnancies but had no changes in the intervening time period.",

This study sought to investigate associations between the SDOH and CVH of adult cancer survivors. Data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (2013-2017) were used. Participants reporting a history of cancer were included, excluding those with only nonmelanotic skin cancer, or with missing data for any domain of SDOH or CVH. SDOH was quantified with a 6-domain, 38-item score, consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations (higher score indicated worse deprivation). CVH was quantified based on the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, but due to unavailable detailed dietary data, a 7-item CVH score was used, with a higher score indicating worse CVH. Survey-specific multivariable Poisson regression was used to test associations between SDOH quartiles and CVH. Altogether, 8,254 subjects were analyzed, representing a population of 10,887,989 persons. Worse SDOH was associated with worse CVH (highest vs lowest quartile: risk ratio 1.30; 95% CI: 1.25-1.35; P\u00a0< 0.001), with a grossly linear relationship between SDOH and CVH scores. Subgroup analysis found significantly stronger associations in younger participants (P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.026) or women (P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.001) but without significant interactions with race (P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.051).

        "AbstractText": "Gap junctions transmit electrical signals in neurons and serve metabolic coupling and chemical communication. Gap junctions are made of intercellular channels with large pores, allowing ions and small molecules to permeate. In the mammalian retina, intercellular coupling fulfills many vital functions in visual signal processing but is also implicated in promoting cell death after insults, such as excitotoxicity or hypoxia. Conversely, some studies also suggested a role for retinal gap junctions in neuroprotection. Recently, gap junctions were also advocated as conduits for therapeutic drug delivery in neurodegenerative disorders. This requires the permeation of rather large molecules through retinal gap junctions. However, the permeability of retinal networks for molecules >0.6 kDa has not been tested systematically. Here, we used the cut-loading method and probed gap junctional networks in the mouse retina for their permeability to cGMP and cAMP coupled to Biotin, using the well-characterized tracer Neurobiotin as control. Biotin-cGMP and -cAMP have a molecular weight of >0.8 kDa. We show that they cannot pass the gap junctions of horizontal cells but can permeate through the gap junctions of specific amacrine cells in the inner retina. These amacrine cells do not comprise AII amacrine cells and nitric oxide-releasing amacrine cells but some unknown type. In summary, we show that some retinal gap junctions are large enough to let molecules >0.8 kDa pass, making the intercellular delivery of therapeutic agents - already successfully exploited, for example, in cancer - also feasible in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Following several anti- viral medication treatment trials that failed to eradicate the infectious process, the patient was treated with infusions of CMV-CTL from a biobank of cryopreserved virus-specific cells. Shortly after the first infusion, a remarkable response was noted. A few days after the second infusion, the retinitis resolved completely. No recurrence was noted at the one-year follow-up, and there was no evidence of GVHD.

We also reviewed the most current literature and phenotypes associated with reported pediatric cases of autoimmune retinopathy. The design of the study was a case report, with a retrospective case series literature review. This study incorporated data from six subjects, with one presenting as an original case report and five being identified from the English-language literature published to date. The materials and methods involved a descriptive analysis of fundus findings, electrophysiologic testing, serum autoantibody testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), brain MRI scanning, and fluorescein angiography, which were performed where available. The study evaluated the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of all subjects and followed their visual function over time. All six subjects had retinal abnormalities that were documented on imaging, while five out of the six subjects had optic nerve abnormalities. Electrophysiologic testing was performed on three subjects, all of whom recorded abnormal results. An underlying neoplastic disorder was described for four subjects. Serum autoantibody testing results were available for four subjects. The serum testing included using antibodies against a 22-kDa antigen, a 35-kDa optic nerve-derived antigen, a 62-kDa antigen, enolase, recoverin, tubulin, and pyruvate kinase M2. Our subject presented 12 years after resection of a ganglioglioma with asymmetric bilateral vision loss, disc edema in one eye, advanced disc pallor in the fellow eye, and bilateral subtle retinal infiltrates, despite having a normal fluorescein angiogram. OCT demonstrated asymmetric ganglion cell layer thinning, which is consistent with the vision loss. Our subject also had abnormal brain MRI findings of widespread pachymeningeal enhancement, but he had a normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. He was initially treated with high-dose pulse steroids, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. He experienced partial visual recovery in both eyes. Pediatric autoimmune retinopathy and optic neuropathy are rare diseases that can present with unique signs and symptoms. In pediatric patients who present with symptoms of subacute progressive vision loss with negative inflammatory workups, a history of prior neoplasm, and/or clinical findings of progressive retinopathy or optic neuropathy, an autoimmune process should be considered in the differential.",

To evaluate the safety of using the Pfannenstiel incision for specimen extraction in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer patients. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and WanFangData were searched for studies published up to March 10, 2023; a random-effects model (RCT) and a fixed-effect model were used to evaluate the safety. Operative time, length of extraction skin incision, overall complications, superficial wound infection, organ/space surgical site infection and incisional hernia were evaluated. A total of 5 studies were included in this research. There were no significant advantages in operation time, length of the incision, overall complications, superficial wound infection and organ/space surgical site in the Pfannenstiel group compared to the no Pfannenstiel group. However, the Pfannenstiel incision has a tendency to increase the length of the incision (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.22 to 0.33; p = 0.71) and the results of the remaining five (operative time,overall complications,incisional hernia, incisional infection and organ/space surgical site infection) are slightly skewed toward the Pfannenstiel incision. It is worth mentioning that incisional hernia (IH) may have an advantage in the Pfannenstiel group compared to the no Pfannenstiel group. Four studies were not at clear risk of bias and two studies were at risk of bias. Our study concludes that the Pfannenstiel incision has a good safety record and it is a good option for extracting specimens during laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer. The Pfannenstiel incision used for laparoscopic surgical specimen extraction has a significantly lower incidence of incisional hernia over no Pfannenstiel.",

Ovarian cancer tissues' CD44+/CD24- (CSCs), RAD6 overexpression and DDB2 underexpression are associated with chemoresistance, recurrence, and poor prognosis of the disease because of the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We tried to analyze the expression of those three proteins while building a predictor scoring system to predict the ovarian cancer chemoresistance from the ovarian cancer tissue immunohistochemistry. We conducted a cohort study of 64 patients divided into two groups (32 patients in each group) at the Cipto Mangunkusumo, Tarakan, Dharmais, and Fatmawati Hospital\u00a0which are located in Jakarta city, Indonesia. The patients underwent cytoreductive debulking and histopathological examination continued by six series of chemotherapy followed by six months of observation. We divided the groups into chemoresistant and chemosensitive by using Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Ovarian cancer tissue immunohistochemistry tests were then performed to count the CSCs, RAD6 and DDB2 expressions. We found relationship between increased CSCs, RAD6 and reduced DDB2 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) expression in ovarian cancer tissue with the chemoresistance. A possible predictor scoring system named IHC-UNEDO scoring was built to aid the ovarian cancer chemoresistance prediction. The conclusion is that CSCs, RAD6 and DDB2 expressions are significantly associated with ovarian cancer chemoresistance, and IHC-UNEDO scoring should be considered as a tool to predict ovarian cancer chemoresistance.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer ranks the top of malignancies that cause cancer-related deaths worldwide. The leaves of Morus alba L are traditional Chinese medicine widely applied in respiratory diseases. Our previous work has demonstrated the anti-lung cancer effect of secondary metabolites of mulberry leaf, but their mechanism of action has still not fully elucidated. We synthesized Moracin N (MAN)-Probe conjugated with alkyne to label lung cancer cells and identified protein targets by chemical proteomic analysis. MAN and its probe exerted similar growth-inhibitory effect on human lung cancer cells. Chemical proteomic results showed that MAN targeted the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint pathway and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, indicating its immune-regulatory function. Cell-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results showed the direct interaction of MAN with PD-L1 protein. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that MAN bound to E158 residue of PD-L1 protein. MAN downregulated the expression levels of PD-L1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and disrupted the PD-L1/programmed death 1 (PD-1) binding, including other secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves Guangsangon E (GSE) and Chalcomoracin (CMR). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-cultured with MAN-treated A549\u00a0cells, resulting in the increase of CD8+ GZMB+ T cells and the decrease of CD8+ PD-1+ T cells. It suggested that MAN exerts anti-cancer effect through blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. In\u00a0vivo, MAN combined with anti-PD-1 antibody significantly inhibited lung cancer development and metastasis, indicating their synergistic effect. Taken together, secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves target the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling, enhance T cell-mediated immunity and inhibit the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Their modulatory effect on tumor microenvironment makes them able to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer.",

We included patients with clinical T0, T1 andT2 invasive breast carcinoma who underwent resection of the primary tumor and axillary staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillar lymph node dissection between 2012 and 2018. Of the 135patients included, 41.5% had ALNI. Regarding univariate analysis, clinical factors correlated with positive ALNM were clinical tumour size>30mm, clinical tumour stage, clinical number of tumours, clinical axillary nodal status and nodal status on ultrasound. Pathologic factors associated with nodal involvement were pathologic tumour stage, tumour grade SBR, number of foci, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and Ki67>20%.In multivariate logistic regression, clinical axillary nodal status, pathologic tumour stage and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) remained as independent predictors of ALNI. Based on these results, we suggest that clinical axillary nodal status, pathologic tumour stage and LVI are predictive factors for ALNM in Tunisian women with early breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Globally, cancer is on the rise despite several interventions. The link between nutrition and cancer has long been established with the consequences of poor nutrition on cancer pathway being dire. Early nutrition intervention is recommended for all cancer patients. To assess malnutrition among patients undergoing chemotherapy at the National Radiotherapy Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Centre of the Korle-Bu Teaching hospital (KBTH) in Accra, Ghana. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 123 patients with different types and stages of cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. Data was collected from December 2018 to January 2019. The PG-SGA tool was used to assess weight loss at one and six months, food intake and nutrition impact symptoms. A correlation test was used to test the association between PGSGA score and Nutritional triaging. A T-test was used to determine the association between chemotherapy cycles and nutrition. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be significant. The results revealed that 5.7% (n= 7) of the patients were well nourished, 31.7% (n= 39) were suspected of being malnourished and 62.6% (n=77) were severely malnourished. About half of the participants (48%) had experienced weight loss ranging between 1-20kg with weight loss \u22645kg being most prevalent at both one month and six months prior to the study. More than half (56.9%, n=70) of the participants were consuming less than their usual intake. Majority of the participants had 4-6 nutritional symptoms (39.0%) with symptoms being mostly mild (39.1%). Poor nutritional status was positively correlated with nutritional symptoms (r=0.747, p<0.001). The PGSGA tool identified that more than half of the patients were severely malnourished hence the need for early nutrition intervention in cancer patients.",

Health workers have a vital role to play in achieving this. Hence, they must be adequately equipped with the requisite knowledge of the condition since they provide information to their clients. This study determined the knowledge, perception, and screening practices on cervical cancer among female nurses and midwives in the Central Region of Ghana. A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey amongst nurses and midwives was used for the study. A convenience sampling technique was applied to yield a representative sample of 130 female nurses and midwives working in Our Lady of Grace Hospital in the Central Region, Ghana. Data was collected from the participants using a self-administered questionnaire. The data was analysed using SPSS version 20, and standard descriptive statistics such as proportions were used to summarize the survey data. Almost all the nurses (99%) had heard of cervical cancer. Majority (97.1%) of the respondents believed cervical cancer is preventable however, 67.6% also believed that it is incurable. Almost half (42.2%) of the respondents did not perceive themselves as at risk of cervical cancer. Thus, only 11.8% of the nurses had ever screened for cervical cancer. However, majority (92.2%) were willing to recommend the screening to others. The respondents of this study had some knowledge of cervical cancer however had low patronage for recommended screening practices. Therefore, strategies must be implemented to increase screening practices among female nurses.",

We attempted to investigate CD10 (Cluster of differentiation 10) and EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) expression in BPT in order to highlight their diagnostic and prognostic values. Eight patients with BPT are recruited from January 2014 to December 2020 and immunohistochemical assessment of CD10 and EGFR is realized. Median age was 27\u00b115.2, the mean tumor size was 9.63\u00b110.21. Only malignant tumours showed expression for EGFR. Borderline and malignant tumors were CD10 positive. Patients overexpressing CD10 were postmenopausal with great tumor size, 25% of these were sarcomatous. Coexistence of CD10 and EGFR overexpression was found in 25% of cases and was associated with age (P=0.008), tumor size (P=0.030) and hitologic types (P=0.014). PC1 and PC2, were extracted, they accounted cumulatively for 94.7% of the variance of the data analysed, it suggests that patient's age and histological type of tumor have significant association with CD10 and EGFR expression in BPT.

Few respondents had good knowledge (11.0%) and positive perception (27.0%) of HPV, cervical cancer and HPV vaccine. The major source of information was social media (46.2%). Half of the respondents reported intention to take the vaccine if recommended by their family doctor (56.3%) and if given parental approval (52.0%), however, many (60.7%) were concerned about the vaccine's side effects. Findings show that parents and health workers influence adolescents' HPV vaccination uptake. The study thus recommends the prioritization of parental involvement in HPV vaccination.

        "AbstractText": "Automated segmentation of multiple organs and tumors from 3D medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans using deep learning methods can aid in diagnosing and treating cancer. However, organs often overlap and are complexly connected, characterized by extensive anatomical variation and low contrast. In addition, the diversity of tumor shape, location, and appearance, coupled with the dominance of background voxels, makes accurate 3D medical image segmentation difficult. In this paper, a novel 3D large-kernel (LK) attention module is proposed to address these problems to achieve accurate multi-organ segmentation and tumor segmentation. The advantages of biologically inspired self-attention and convolution are combined in the proposed LK attention module, including local contextual information, long-range dependencies, and channel adaptation. The module also decomposes the LK convolution to optimize the computational cost and can be easily incorporated into CNNs such as U-Net. Comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrated the feasibility of convolutional decomposition and explored the most efficient and effective network design. Among them, the best Mid-type 3D LK attention-based U-Net network was evaluated on CT-ORG and BraTS 2020 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance when compared to avant-garde CNN and Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation. The performance improvement due to the proposed 3D LK attention module was statistically validated.",

Methods \u2003Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from treatment-naive patients with SNUC were selected. Three cases of SR-SNUC, four cases of SD-SNUC, and four samples of nontumor tissue (control samples) were selected. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing was performed. Results \u2003SR-SNUC had a higher number of variants (1 variant for every 15,000 bases) compared with SD-SNUC (1 variant every 29,000 bases). The ratio of missense to silent mutation ratio was higher for SR-SNUC (0.8) as compared with SD-SNUC (0.7). Approximately 1,500 genes were differentially expressed between SR-SNUC and SD-SNUC. The genes that had a higher expression in SR-SNUC included TPD52L1, B3GNT3, GFY, TJP3, ELL3, CYP4F3, ALDH3B2, CKMT1B, VIPR1, SLC7A5, PPP2R2C, UPK3B, MUC1, ELF5, STY7, and H2AC14.

We retrospectively collected and processed a total of 1344 histopathologic findings of the prostate at the Zagreb UHC. Our results show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a statistically significant decrease in the absolute number of biopsy and surgical procedures on prostate at Zagreb UHC, and so was the number of newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed cases of prostate cancer. During the observed time of the pandemic (March 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020), there was a 37.5% decrease in the absolute number of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases compared to the same period of the previous year (March 19, 2019 to December 31, 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind that is based on the number of prostate cancer diagnoses in Croatia. By observing the early period of the pandemic, our results provide important guidelines for monitoring and understanding the long-term consequences of the pandemic on the prostate cancer morbidity and mortality.",

From November 2016 until the end of 2021, there were 280 consecutive PNs and RNs included in this cross-sectional study. Exclusion criteria were nephrectomies due to non-oncologic reasons and transitional cell carcinoma. There were 229 RNs and 51 PNs, median age of all patients was 62.5 (range 34-84) years. In the RN group, there were 197 renal cell carcinomas (RCC), predominantly clear-cell subtype, while among others there were 8 multilocular cystic renal neoplasms of low malignant potential (MCRNLMP) and 6 oncocytomas and angiomyolipomas each. There were 44 RCCs, 4 oncocytomas, 1 MCRNLMP and 2 cysts removed with PN; median R.E.N.A.L. score was 5. RN group had greater tumor diameters and higher tumor grade, higher postoperative creatinine levels and complications of higher grade. There was no difference in median hospital stay (6 days) and follow-up (20 months). With regard to oncologic safety, preservation of kidney function and lower overall morbidity, PN should be preferred to RN whenever oncologically safe and technically feasible.",

        "AbstractText": "Kidney cancer is estimated to be responsible for more than 400 000 new cancer cases and 180 000 cancer deaths a year. Its incidence is increasing in the majority of developed countries, due to an increased prevalence of recognized risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use and obesity, as well as incidental findings on unrelated diagnostic imaging procedures. Mortality is decreasing in the majority of European countries, due to improvements in treatment and stage at diagnosis shift with more tumors being diagnosed at an early stage. In this paper, we present kidney cancer incidence and mortality trends in Croatia using joinpoint regression analysis. The incidence was rising throughout the 2001-2019 period, with an annual percent change (APC) of 2.5%; more so in men (APC of 2.5%) than in women (APC of 2.2%). Mortality increased during the 2001-2014 period (APC of 2.4%), but started to decrease in recent years (APC -2.7%, 2014-2020). Unlike sex differences observed in other European countries, with more favorable mortality trends found in women, our study showed a constant increase in mortality in women (APC of 1.2%) and a recent decrease in mortality in men, starting in 2013 (APC of -2.8%), after a period of increase from 2001 (APC of 3.3%).",

        "AbstractText": "The objective of this study was to analyze, in a randomized controlled multicenter trial, whether a xenogeneic collagen matrix (XCM) could be used to cover skin defects. Patients with the need for skin excisions were recruited and randomized to treatment with a skin graft after a period of granulation or to treatment with an XCM. The results were evaluated by two independent observers on the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. On this scale, scars are ranked from 1 to 10 in six different categories. Results range from 6 to 60, with lower scores representing scars closer to normal skin. The results 6 months after reconstruction were used as primary endpoint and compared in a non-inferiority approach. A total of 39 wounds in the head and neck region were analyzed. The mean results were 16.55 (standard deviation 6.8) for XCM and 16.83 (standard deviation 8.21) in the control group. The result of the XCM was not significantly inferior to the result of the skin graft (p\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Within the limitations of the study, it seems that the use of xenogeneic collagen matrices is a viable alternative to other approaches in small skin defects, and therefore should be taken into account whenever the reduction of patient morbidity to a minimum is the priority.

Although kinase inhibitors are one of the largest groups of approved drugs, much of the human kinome remains unexplored but potentially druggable. Computational approaches, such as machine learning, offer efficient solutions for exploring kinase-compound interactions and uncovering novel binding activities. Despite the increasing availability of three-dimensional (3D) protein and compound structures, existing methods predominantly focus on exploiting local features from one-dimensional protein sequences and two-dimensional molecular graphs to predict binding affinities, overlooking the 3D nature of the binding process. Here we present KDBNet, a deep learning algorithm that incorporates 3D protein and molecule structure data to predict binding affinities. KDBNet uses graph neural networks to learn structure representations of protein binding pockets and drug molecules, capturing the geometric and spatial characteristics of binding activity. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to quantify and calibrate the uncertainties of KDBNet's predictions, enhancing its utility in model-guided discovery in chemical or protein space. Experiments demonstrated that KDBNet outperforms existing deep learning models in predicting kinase-drug binding affinities. The uncertainties estimated by KDBNet are informative and well-calibrated with respect to prediction errors. When integrated with a Bayesian optimization framework, KDBNet enables data-efficient active learning and accelerates the exploration and exploitation of diverse high-binding kinase-drug pairs.",

To our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the outcomes of laryngectomy in patients aged over 75 years, which prompted us to present this unique series. Methods We reviewed departmental records at the University College Hospital,\u00a0London over a 10-year period, and identified a total of 18 patients over the age of 75 years who underwent total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic features and outcomes for each patient. Results The age of the cohort ranged from 75 to 90 years, with a mean age of 79.8 years. All patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of 3 or more (due to age), with a mean of 4.7, and a maximum score of 8 for two patients. Length of inpatient stay varied significantly, ranging from 20 to 149 days, with a mean of 46 days. We identified 14 patients who underwent laryngectomy prior to September 2017, in whom the five-year survival was 21.4%. The three-year survival rate for all patients was 22.2%. In bivariate analysis, advanced age at surgery\u00a0positively correlated with increased length of hospital admission and increased incidence of complications, although these results were not statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions Our study highlights the significance of the impact of age and comorbidities on postoperative outcomes and sheds light on the unique challenges faced by an ageing population.

This study aimed at determining the rate of non-diagnosis in suspected lesions and reviewing the management challenges of ovarian tumours highly suspicious for malignancy in our hospital. A three-year retrospective review of patients' records from the ward, clinic, theatre, and histopathology laboratory was carried out. Cases with high indices of suspicion for ovarian cancer (ovarian tumour with malignant radiologic features with any of ascites, pleural effusion, as well as cachexia, anaemia, or evidence of metastasis) were included. In-depth interviews were carried out with a consultant from each specialty of Radiology, Radio-oncology, Pathology, and Gynaecologic oncology at the gynaecologic oncology multidisciplinary team meeting. One hundred and twenty-two cases of highly suspicious ovarian malignancies were seen with a mean age of 40.6 years. Of these, 28 (23%) had surgery and 77% did not have any form of histological diagnosis. Of those that had surgery, 13 (46.4%) had upfront surgery and 15 (53.6%) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). Only two cases had documented complete (R0) debulking. Among those that had upfront surgery, one case (7.7%) was an ovarian fibroid and one (7.7%) was a fibrosarcoma while two cases (15.4%) were borderline ovarian tumours. Chemotherapy was commenced based on malignant cells on ascitic or pleural fluid cytology in three cases. Of all the malignant cases, epithelial carcinomas were commonest accounting for 48%. Aside from the general late presentation of cases, insufficient funds for treatment, poor coverage of health insurance for cancer care, unavailability of routine immunohistochemistry, lack of germline and somatic testing, non-availability or prohibitive cost of some chemotherapeutic agents, unavailability of maintenance therapies, inadequate capacity to manage toxicities, inadequate skill across all specialties, unavailability / erratic function of computerized tomography scans and unavailable positron emission tomography, lack of interventional radiology facility amongst others were all identified as challenges to management.

NTB is available as oral capsule formulation, but its ability to detect degradants formed through oxidative, photolytic and hydrolytic processes makes it difficult to quantify. In the current work, a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated. The developed method is simple, precise, reproducible, stable and accurate. The inherent stability of NTB was evaluated using the proposed analytical method approach and force degradation studies were carried out. NTB was separated chromatographically on the Shimadzu C 18 column as stationary phase (250 \u00d74.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) using an isocratic elution method with 0.1% v/v triethyl amine (TEA) in HPLC grade water and acetonitrile (ACN) in the ratio 35:65% v/v. The mobile phase was pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the eluent was detected at 390 nm wavelength. NTB was eluted at 6.77\u00b10.00 min of retention time (t R) with a correlation coefficient of 0.999, the developed method was linear in the concentration range of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml to 4.5 \u00b5g/ml.

        "AbstractText": "Transfer learning provides a powerful tool for incorporating data from related studies into a target study of interest. In epidemiology and medical studies, the classification of a target disease could borrow information across other related diseases and populations. In this work, we consider transfer learning for high-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs). A novel algorithm, TransHDGLM, that integrates data from the target study and the source studies is proposed. Minimax rate of convergence for estimation is established and the proposed estimator is shown to be rate-optimal. Statistical inference for the target regression coefficients is also studied. Asymptotic normality for a debiased estimator is established, which can be used for constructing coordinate-wise confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. Numerical studies show significant improvement in estimation and inference accuracy over GLMs that only use the target data. The proposed methods are applied to a real data study concerning the classification of colorectal cancer using gut microbiomes, and are shown to enhance the classification accuracy in comparison to methods that only use the target data.",

        "AbstractText": "Participation in sexual medicine research may depend on a patient's willingness to speak openly about sex, sexual function, or other sensitive topics. These topics may be difficult or uncomfortable to talk about, and this discomfort may be further amplified when a patient comes from a cultural background that stigmatizes open conversation about sex and sexuality. We used qualitative analysis to better understand the intersection between cultural identity, the experience of sexual dysfunction as a side-effect of pelvic radiotherapy, and willingness to communicate about sexual dysfunction with healthcare providers, in Cuban American women in Miami, Florida. Doing so, we found four unique themes among Cuban American participants regarding the intersection of national identity, Hispanic identity, Catholic religion, and their experience of radiotherapy-related sexual dysfunction: Marianismo, Machismo, Familismo, and Espiritismo. These themes, a reflection of the cohort's shared identity, were found to have an effect on participant views of sexual health, romantic relationships, coping strategies, and relative comfort discussing problems with intercourse. These cultural values served as barriers to openly discussing sexual dysfunction with not just medical providers and research teams but also their partners, families, and friends. In order to encourage Cuban American participation in sexual medicine studies, future research should evaluate strategies to overcome these barriers.",

        "AbstractText": "Flexible needle insertion procedures are common in minimally-invasive surgeries for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. Bevel-tip needles provide physicians the capability to steer the needle during long insertions to avoid vital anatomical structures in the patient and reduce post-operative patient discomfort. To provide needle placement feedback to the physician, sensors are embedded into needles for determining the real-time 3D shape of the needle during operation without needing to visualize the needle intra-operatively. Through expansive research in fiber optics, a plethora of bio-compatible, MRI-compatible, optical shape-sensors have been developed to provide real-time shape feedback, such as single-core and multicore fiber Bragg gratings. In this paper, we directly compare single-core fiber-based and multicore fiber-based needle shape-sensing through similarly constructed, four-active area sensorized bevel-tip needles inserted into phantom and ex-vivo tissue on the same experimental platform. In this work, we found that for shape-sensing in phantom tissue, the two needles performed identically with a p-value of 0.164 > 0.05, but in ex-vivo real tissue, the single-core fiber sensorized needle significantly outperformed the multicore fiber configuration with a p-value of 0.0005 < 0.05. This paper also presents the experimental platform and method for directly comparing these optical shape sensors for the needle shape-sensing task, as well as provides direction, insight and required considerations for future work in constructively optimizing sensorized needles.",

From April 2015 to October 2022, we prospectively enrolled 331 patients with suspected PCNs in our prospective database. Among them, 112 patients chosen to receive surgical resection were included. Only 96 patients who underwent EUS-guided cystic fluid LBC were finally studied. The diagnostic values of LBC for differentiating benign and malignant PCNs and subtypes of PCNs were evaluated. There were 71 female and 25 male patients with a mean age of 47.6 \u00b1 14.4 years. The median cyst size was 43.4 mm. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LBC for the differentiation of benign and malignant PCNs were 96.9%, 57.1%, 100%, 100%, and 96.7%, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy of LBC for specific cyst types was 33.3% (32/96). Cysts located in the pancreatic body/tail or with irregular shapes were more likely to obtain a definite LBC diagnosis. At the same time, age, sex, tumor size, cystic fluid viscosity, operation time, needle type, and presence of septation were not significantly different. Liquid-based cytology alone is useful for differentiating benign PCNs from malignant PCNs and can successfully characterize the PCN subtypes in one-third of patients.

        "AbstractText": "The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL has drastically changed the treatment approach of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), greatly prolonged the life of CML patients, and improved their prognosis. However, TKI resistance is still a major problem with CML patients, reducing the efficacy of treatment and their quality of life. TKI resistance is mainly divided into BCR-ABL-dependent and BCR-ABL-independent resistance. Now, the main clinical strategy addressing TKI resistance is to switch to newly developed TKIs. However, data have shown that these new drugs may cause serious adverse reactions and intolerance and cannot address all resistance mutations. Therefore, finding new therapeutic targets to overcome TKI resistance is crucial and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a focus. The UPS mediates the degradation of most proteins in organisms and controls a wide range of physiological processes. In recent years, the study of UPS in hematological malignant tumors has resulted in effective treatments, such as bortezomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In CML, the components of UPS cooperate or antagonize the efficacy of TKI by directly or indirectly affecting the ubiquitination of BCR-ABL, interfering with CML-related signaling pathways, and negatively or positively affecting leukemia stem cells. Some of these molecules may help overcome TKI resistance and treat CML. In this review, the mechanism of TKI resistance is briefly described, the components of UPS are introduced, existing studies on UPS participating in TKI resistance are listed, and UPS as the therapeutic target and strategies are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Bronchoscopy is currently the least invasive method for definitively diagnosing lung cancer, which kills more people in the United States than any other form of cancer. Successfully diagnosing suspicious lung nodules requires accurate localization of the bronchoscope relative to a planned biopsy site in the airways. This task is challenging because the lung deforms intraoperatively due to respiratory motion, the airways lack photometric features, and the anatomy's appearance is repetitive. In this paper, we introduce a real-time camera-based method for accurately localizing a bronchoscope with respect to a planned needle insertion pose. Our approach uses deep learning and accounts for deformations and overcomes limitations of global pose estimation by estimating pose relative to anatomical landmarks. Specifically, our learned model considers airway bifurcations along the airway wall as landmarks because they are distinct geometric features that do not vary significantly with respiratory motion. We evaluate our method in a simulated dataset of lungs undergoing respiratory motion. The results show that our method generalizes across patients and localizes the bronchoscope with accuracy sufficient to access the smallest clinically-relevant nodules across all levels of respiratory deformation, even in challenging distal airways. Our method could enable physicians to perform more accurate biopsies and serve as a key building block toward accurate autonomous robotic bronchoscopy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of FV-EUS in patients who have undergone PD. Patients with PD who were scheduled to undergo diagnosis and treatment using FV-EUS for H-J or P-J lesions were enrolled in this single-center prospective study. After observation of the P-J and H-J using FV-EUS according to a predetermined protocol, treatment using FV-EUS was performed as needed. A total of 30 patients were enrolled, and FV-EUS was used to observe P-J and H-J in 24 and 28 patients, respectively. The detection rates of P-J and H-J by endoscopy were 50% (12/24) and 96.4% (27/28), respectively, and by EUS were 70.8% (17/24) and 100% (28/28), respectively.

In the past decade, the treatment of SCLC has largely remained unchanged, and chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of SCLC treatment. The therapeutic value of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy for SCLC is low, and only a few SCLC patients have shown a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are tumor cells shed from solid tumor masses into the peripheral circulation and are key to tumor metastasis. Single-cell sequencing has revealed that the genetic profiles of individual CTCs are highly heterogeneous and contribute to the poor outcome and prognosis of SCLC patients. Theoretically, phenotypic analysis of CTCs may be able to predict the diagnostic significance of new potential targets for metastatic tumors.

CMDs included self-reported hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between healthy lifestyle and CMD.

We have developed an ML pipeline including three separate feature selection processes and applied it to routine patient care data from the electronic health records\u00a0of 1910 cancer patients at the University of California Davis Medical Center. Our ML-based prediction model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic\u00a0curve of 0.778\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) when trained on a set of 15 features.

Our result surpasses the most validated clinical scoring system for VTE risk assessment in cancer patients by 16.1%. We additionally found cancer stage information to be a useful predictor after all performed feature selection processes despite not being used in existing score-based approaches. From these findings, we observe that ML can offer new insights and a significant improvement over the most validated clinical VTE risk scoring systems in cancer patients. The results of this study also allowed us to draw insight into our feature pool and identify the features that could have the most utility in the context of developing an efficient ML classifier. While a model trained on our entire feature pool of 29 features significantly outperformed the traditionally used clinical scoring system, we were able to achieve an equivalent performance using a subset of only 15 features through strategic feature selection methods. These results are encouraging for potential applications of ML to predicting cancer-associated VTE in clinical settings such as in bedside decision support systems where feature availability may be limited.",

Flow cytometry and high-dimensional analysis clustered macrophages post co-culture. A manual gating strategy was generated to recapitulate these clusters and was applied to a repeat experimental run. Both runs were analysed to examine the prevalence of each cluster, representing a unique macrophage phenotype, with and without ADSC-EVs. Following the addition of ADSC-EVs, M0-like macrophages demonstrated a reciprocal shift of cell distribution from a cluster with a 'high inflammatory profile' (CD36+++CD206+++CD86+++; 16.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) to a cluster with a 'lower inflammatory profile' (CD36+CD206+CD86+; 35 \u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.5%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). M1-like macrophages shifted from a cluster with a 'high inflammatory profile' (CD206++CD11b++CD36++CD163++; 26.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0024) to a 'lower inflammatory profile' (CD206+CD11b+CD36+CD163+; 72.8 \u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0007). There was no shift in M2-like clusters following ADSC-EV treatment. ADSC-EVs are complex regulators of macrophage phenotype that can shift macrophages away from a heightened pro-inflammatory state.",

However, the cardiovascular impact of CR-modeled interventions has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a multidisciplinary model of CR reduces cardiotoxicity and improves cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. We randomly assigned patients with stage I to III breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy to the CR intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a037) or usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a037). The intervention included guideline-directed management of cardiovascular risk factors, dietary counselling, and supervised exercise for 52\u00a0weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and serum biomarkers were acquired at baseline and 52\u00a0weeks. There was no difference in the primary outcome, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), between groups at 52\u00a0weeks (61%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%).

We review recent experimental and computational approaches that characterize gene regulatory networks, splice regulatory networks, and the resulting transcriptome and proteome they mediate during differentiation. Such approaches include long-read RNA sequencing, which has demonstrated high-resolution profiling of mRNA isoforms, and Cas13-based CRISPR, which could make possible high-throughput isoform screening. Collectively, these developments enable systems-level profiling of factors contributing to cell state. Overall, gene and splice regulatory networks are important in defining cell state.

The relationship between both PTSS and PTG is not clear in CC survivors. Assessing challenges to core beliefs and rumination could give information regarding the different paths that lead to traumatic responses. Thus, this study aims to identify childhood cancer survivors' profiles from PTSS and PTG measures and to examine the pathways of relationships between PTSS and PTG, rumination, and challenge to core belief. Sixty-two CC survivors completed surveys on their childhood cancer experience, PTSS, PTG, challenge to core beliefs, and rumination. High PTG scores among childhood cancer survivors (Cluster 1), High PTSS scores among childhood cancer survivors (Cluster 2), and Childhood cancer survivors without changes (Cluster 3). Network analysis found that the challenge to core beliefs is the central point in the relationship between the variables, in a direct and positive relationship with PTG. We found an indirect path from challenge to core beliefs to PTSS, mediated by intrusive and deliberative ruminations. The combined findings suggested that there are different profiles related to trauma in CC survivors and the relationship between PTSS and PTG is mediated by the challenge to core beliefs and deliberative and intrusive rumination.",

In this study, we present a platform to track EVs over the course of invasive development of human prostate cancer cell (PC3) tumoroids utilizing in vivo-mimicking extracellular matrix-based 3D cultures. Using this EV production method, combined with proteomic profiling, we show that PC3 tumoroids secrete EVs with previously undefined protein cargo. Intriguingly, an increase in EV amounts and extensive changes in the EV protein composition were detected upon invasive transition of the tumoroids. The changes in EV protein cargo were counteracted by chemical inhibition of invasion.

However, existing EV-miRNA extraction technologies have a complex two-step process that results in low extraction efficiency and inconsistent results. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a new single-step extraction method, called miRQuick, for efficient and high-recovery extraction of EV-miRNAs from samples. The miRQuick method involves adding positively charged substances to the sample, causing negatively charged EVs to quickly aggregate and precipitate. A membrane lysate is then added to extract only miRNA. The entire process can be completed within an hour using standard laboratory equipment. We validated the miRQuick method using various analytical techniques and compared its performance to other methods for plasma, urine and saliva samples. The miRQuick method demonstrated significantly higher performance than other methods, not only for blood plasma but also for urine and saliva samples. Furthermore, we successfully extracted and detected nine biomarker candidate miRNAs in the plasma of breast cancer patients using miRQuick.

Therefore, the possibility of interconversion of luminal states and their specific markers alteration under the control of tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) deserves to be further investigated. To activate normal human fibroblasts, liquid overlay technique or nemosis was used and \u03b1-SMA protein expression, CAFs marker, in fibroblastic spheroids was measured by blotting. The luminal A, MCF-7, and luminal B, MDA-MB 361, cell lines were treated with normal and spheroidal/activated fibroblast conditioned medium for 48 hours. The morphological changes of both luminal A and B cells were evaluated by invert light microscopy and analyzed through the shape factor formula. Moreover, chemo-sensitivity, proliferation, and changes in ER-related and proliferative genes expression levels were assessed respectively via MTT assay, Ki67 expression Immunofluorescence assay, real time PCR and Annexin V-FITC techniques. Activated (spheroidal) fibroblasts, expressed \u03b1SMA marker two folds more than monolayer cultured fibroblasts. Our study indicated a significant increase in IC50 of both luminal A and B cell lines after being treated with conditioned medium particularly in treated group with spheroidal conditioned medium. Studying Morphological changes using shape factor formula demonstrated more aggressiveness with gaining mesenchymal features in both luminal A and B subtypes by increasing exposure time. Changes in the expression of Ki67 were observed following treatment with fibroblastic and spheroidal paracrine secretome. Driven Data from Ki67 assay supports the luminal A and B interconversion by elevated Ki67 expression in luminal A and lowered Ki67 expression in luminal B. Gene expression analysis revealed that anti-apoptotic Bcl2 gene expression in both luminal types treated with condition medium has been increased though there has seen no interchange in expression of ER-related and proliferative genes between luminal A (MCF7) and luminal B (MDA-MB361) subtypes, the results of Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry test indicated a decrease in the population of both early and late apoptotic cells in groups treated with both fibroblastic and spheroidal condition medium compared to of control group. Under the paracrine influence of fibroblast cells, both luminal A (MCF7) and luminal B (MDA-MB) subtypes of breast cancer gained invasive, anti-apoptotic, and chemoresistance features which are mostly increased by activated(spheroidal) fibroblasts conditioned medium mimicking CAFs.

These two miRNAs regulate numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation and migration. This research was intended to explore the simultaneous replacement effect of miR-143, and miR-145 on in vitro tumorgenicity of U87 glioblastoma cells. U87 cells were cultured, and transfected with miR-143-5p and miR-145-5p. Afterward, the changes in cell viability, and apoptosis induction were determined by MTT assay and Annexin V/PI staining. The accumulation of cells at the cell cycle phases was assessed using the flow cytometry. Wound healing and colony formation assays were performed to study cell migration. qRT-PCR and western blot techniques were utilized to quantify gene expression levels. Our results showed that miR-143-5p and 145-5p exogenous upregulation cooperatively diminished cell viability, and enhanced U-87 cell apoptosis by modulating Caspase-3/8/9, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein expression. The combination therapy increased accumulation of cells at the sub-G1 phase by modulating CDK1, Cyclin D1, and P53 protein expression. miR-143/145-5p significantly decreased cell migration, and reduced colony formation ability by the downregulation of c-Myc and CD44 gene expression. Furthermore, the results showed the combination therapy of these miRNAs could remarkably downregulate phosphorylated-AKT expression levels. In conclusion, miR-143 and miR-145 were indicated to show cooperative anti- cancer effects on glioblastoma cells via modulating AKT signaling as a new therapeutic approach.",

Fluorescent MVs mixed with hydrogels were employed to detect MV diffusion using fluorometric methods. Our results showed that MVs specifically bound type I collagen and diffused freely out of fibrin and type III collagen.

The development of tetraspanin-based pHluorin reporters has enabled the real-time analysis of EV release at the plasma membrane. Here, we employed CD81-pHluorin to investigate mechanisms of EV release in ovarian cancer (OC) cells and report a novel role for the Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPC3 in EV-mediated communication. We found that specific activation of TRPC3 increased Ca2+ signalling in SKOV3 cells and stimulated an immediate increase in EV release. Ca2+-stimulants histamine and ionomycin likewise induced EV release, and imaging analysis revealed distinct stimulation-dependent temporal and spatial release dynamics. Interestingly, inhibition of TRPC3 attenuated histamine-stimulated Ca2+-entry and EV release, indicating that TRPC3 is likely to act downstream of histamine signalling in EV biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that direct activation of TRPC3 as well as the application of EVs derived from TRPC3-activated cells increased SKOV3 proliferation. Our data provides insights into the molecular mechanisms and dynamics underlying EV release in OC cells, proposing a key role for TRPC3 in EV biogenesis.",

The minimal treatments available for this aggressive type of leukemia has been an ongoing problem. Chromosomal translocations of the KMT2A gene are known as MLL, which expresses MLL fusion proteins. A protein called menin is an important oncogenic cofactor for these MLL fusion proteins, thus providing a new avenue for treatments against this subset of acute leukemias. In this study, we report results using the structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach to discover potential novel MLL-mediated leukemia inhibitors from natural products against menin. The three-dimensional (3D) protein model was derived from Protein Databank (Protein ID: 4GQ4), and EasyModeller 4.0 and I-TASSER were used to fix missing residues during rebuilding. Out of the ten protein models generated (five from EasyModeller and I-TASSER each), one model was selected. The selected model demonstrated the most reasonable quality and had 75.5% of residues in the most favored regions, 18.3% of residues in additionally allowed regions, 3.3% of residues in generously allowed regions, and 2.9% of residues in disallowed regions. A ligand library containing 25,131 ligands from a Chinese database was virtually screened using AutoDock Vina, in addition to three known menin inhibitors. The top 10 compounds including ZINC000103526876, ZINC000095913861, ZINC000095912705, ZINC000085530497, ZINC000095912718, ZINC000070451048, ZINC000085530488, ZINC000095912706, ZINC000103580868, and ZINC000103584057 had binding energies of -11.0, -10.7, -10.6, -10.2, -10.2, -9.9, -9.9, -9.9, -9.9, and -9.9 kcal/mol, respectively. To confirm the stability of the menin-ligand complexes and the binding mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations including molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) computations were performed. The amino acid residues that were found to be potentially crucial in ligand binding included Phe243, Met283, Cys246, Tyr281, Ala247, Ser160, Asn287, Asp185, Ser183, Tyr328, Asn249, His186, Leu182, Ile248, and Pro250. MI-2-2 and PubChem CIDs 71777742 and 36294 were shown to possess anti-menin properties; thus, this justifies a need to experimentally determine the activity of the identified compounds. The compounds identified herein were found to have good pharmacological profiles and had negligible toxicity. Additionally, these compounds were predicted as antileukemic, antineoplastic, chemopreventive, and apoptotic agents. The 10 natural compounds can be further explored as potential novel agents for the effective treatment of MLL-mediated leukemia.",

However, the safe, efficient, and specific delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 components into cells and tissues remains a challenge. While many currently available delivery methods achieve high levels of gene editing effects in vivo, they often result in genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are cell-derived lipid nanoparticles, are capable of transferring protein and nucleic acid cargoes between cells, making them a promising endogenous alternative to synthetic delivery methods. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the currently available strategies for EV-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9. These strategies include cell-based, passive loading obtained by overexpression of CRISPR/Cas9, active loading involving protein or RNA dimerization, and loading into already purified EVs. All these approaches suggest that EV-based CRISPR/Cas9 delivery is useful for achieving both in vitro and in vivo gene editing. Despite that, substantial variations in cellular uptake and gene editing efficiencies indicate that further improvement and standardization are required for the therapeutic use of EVs as a CRISPR/Cas9 delivery vehicle. These improvements include, but is not limited to, the high-yield purification of EVs, increased loading and release efficiencies, as well as improved tissue- or cell-specific targeting specificities.",

The authors sought to assess the risk of new-onset AF, AF risk factors, and the impact of AF on mortality in patients with lymphoma and no history of AF. The University of Rochester Medical Center Lymphoma Database was used to identify patients. The primary outcome was any AF episode identified using the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision codes. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the risk of AF through the use of a time-dependent covariate for treatment overall as well as separate time-varying measures of BTKi (mainly ibrutinib) and non-BTKi treatment. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was determined using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Among 1,957 lymphoma patients, the rate of AF at 5-years following initiation of BTKi treatment was higher (25%) compared to those receiving non-BTKi therapy (8%), and those receiving no treatment (4%). Multivariable analysis showed that BTKi treatment was associated with pronounced increased risk for AF compared to no treatment (HR:\u00a05.07 [95% CI: 2.88-8.90; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001]).

The National Readmission Database (2015-2019) was used to identify all AF patients stratified by the cancer diagnosis, type, and CHA2DS2VASc category (low; moderate; high risk). Outcomes at 30-day readmission were compared between cancer and noncancer groups using hierarchical multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. A total of 6,996,088 AF patients were identified at index admission. Of these, 4,242,630 (642,237 cancer, 3,600,393 noncancer) were readmitted at 30\u00a0days. Cancer patients (92.1%) had a higher proportion of high CHA2DS2VASc scores compared with their noncancer counterparts (89.8%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The 30-day readmission rate and incidence of major bleeding in cancer patients were significantly higher compared with their corresponding noncancer group across all CHA2DS2VASc categories.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer incidence rates are rising at an alarming rate in India and are expected to rise by 12% in the next 5 years. Hence, a thorough knowledge of the existing scope of the cancer problem is required to provide an approach for analyzing and regulating the impact of cancer across the country. This study aimed to determine whether the cancer incidence rates of all the states and union territories across the six geographical regions of India are statistically different from each other or not and also to identify the highly cancer-affected states. The data have been obtained from the website www.indiastat.com from 2009 to 2020. The one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's test and t-test, is used for the statistical evaluation. The multiple comparison tests revealed that the difference between the cancer incidence rates is significant in all the states and union territories in every region of India. The highly affected states in the six geographical regions of India are Uttar Pradesh (UP), Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh. The most highly affected state among them is UP. These states contributed to nearly half of India's cancer burden in 2020. This study offers significant information on the current status of cancer incidence rates in India for 12 years. As India is observing an increase in cancer incidence, therefore, additional efforts are required to strengthen cancer prevention and control strategies, particularly in India's most cancer-affected states.",

        "AbstractText": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrinological disorders affecting 6%-8% of women in reproductive years. An early liberal PCOS screening appears to be a cost-effective strategy, benefiting earlier diagnosis and intervention. The objectives are to measure the prevalence of PCOS and factors associated with PCOS among young girl students of a University in Central Gujarat. All consenting girl medical students enrolled in MBBS curriculum during 2013-2017 were given a self-administered questionnaire (for signs and symptoms of PCOS), taking due prior permissions; during January 2018-June 2019. Using Rotterdam (2006) criteria, those who were screened for PCOS were subjected to abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and if required, laboratory investigations (random blood sugar, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free testosterone). The proportion of young women having PCOS as per the Rotterdam and European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (EHSRE) Criteria are reported. The study enrolled 308 girl medical students. More than one-tenth of the study participants (11.7%, 36/308) had confirmed PCOS (Rotterdam Criteria). As per the EHSRE criteria, 24/36 had classic PCOS, 11/36 had ovulatory phenotype, and 01/36 had the non-hyperandrogenic phenotype PCOS. USG was required in 123/308 (39%); of which 91 consented and 16/91 (18%) had conclusive PCOS. Twenty-three girls required laboratory investigations, of which two had abnormal values suggestive of PCOS. Irregular menses and hirsutism were significantly associated with the PCOS (P < 0.05). The proportion of young medical students with PCOS was 12%. Irregular menses and hirsutism were significantly associated with PCOS.",

        "AbstractText": "The risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is estimated in daily practice solely based on clinical criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic relevance of common somatic mutations with respect to tumor aggressiveness and outcomes of ccRCC patients after definitive treatment. Primary tumors from 37 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy were analyzed for presence of somatic mutations using a 15-gene targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Associations to histopathologic characteristics and outcomes were investigated in the study cohort (n=37) and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cohort (n=451). VHL was the most frequently mutated gene (51%), followed by PBRM1 (27%), BAP1 (13%), SETD2 (13%), KDM5C (5%), ATM (5%), MTOR (5%), and PTEN (3%). One-third of patients did not have any somatic mutations within the 15-gene panel. The vast majority of tumors harboring no mutations at all or VHL-only mutations (51%) were more frequently of smaller size (pT1-2) and earlier stage (I/II), whereas presence of any other gene mutations in various combinations with or without VHL was enriched in larger (pT3) and higher stage tumors (III) (p=0.02). No recurrences were noted in patients with unmutated tumors or VHL-only mutations as opposed to three relapses in patients with non- VHL somatic mutations (p=0.06). Presence of somatic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, or PTEN genes in 451 TCGA ccRCC patients was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with unaltered tumors (q=0.01). Preliminary findings from this ongoing study support the prognostic value of non- VHL mutations including PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, and PTEN in primary ccRCC tumors as surrogates of earlier recurrence and potential selection for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition.",

Circular RNAs are expressed in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner and often localize to specific subcellular regions or organelles for functions. The dysregulation of circular RNAs from birth to death is linked to the pathogenesis and progression of diverse diseases.

Previous studies have focused primarily on tumor-associated protein-coding genes such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as their associated oncogenic pathways. However, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), rising stars in diverse physiological and pathological processes, have recently emerged as additional modulators in tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on two typical kinds of ncRNAs: long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). We describe the molecular patterns of ncRNAs and focus on the roles of ncRNAs in cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor cells, and tumor environmental cells. CSCs are a small subset of tumor cells and are generally considered to be cells that initiate tumorigenesis, and dozens of ncRNAs have been defined as critical modulators in CSC maintenance and oncogenesis. Moreover, ncRNAs are widely involved in oncogenetic processes, including sustaining proliferation, resisting cell death, genome instability, metabolic disorders, immune escape and metastasis. We also discuss the potential applications of ncRNAs in tumor diagnosis and therapy. The progress in ncRNA research greatly improves our understanding of ncRNAs in oncogenesis and provides new potential targets for future tumor therapy.",

Studies have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is one of the major transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pathogenic microorganisms such as SARS-CoV-2 can survive in the air and cause widespread infection among people. Early monitoring of pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere and accurate epidemic prediction are the frontier guarantee for preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. Monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms in the air, especially in densely populated areas, may raise the possibility to detect viruses before people are widely infected and contain the epidemic at an earlier stage. The multi-scale coupled accurate epidemic prediction system can provide support for governments to analyze the epidemic situation, allocate health resources, and formulate epidemic response policies. This review first elaborates on the effects of the atmospheric environment on pathogenic microorganism transmission, which lays a theoretical foundation for the monitoring and prediction of epidemic development. Secondly, the monitoring technique development and the necessity of monitoring pathogenic microorganisms in the atmosphere are summarized and emphasized. Subsequently, this review introduces the major epidemic prediction methods and highlights the significance to realize a multi-scale coupled epidemic prediction system by strengthening the multidisciplinary cooperation of epidemiology, atmospheric sciences, environmental sciences, sociology, demography, etc. By summarizing the achievements and challenges in monitoring and prediction of pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere, this review proposes suggestions for epidemic response, namely, the establishment of an integrated monitoring and prediction platform for pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere.",

The occurrence of abnormal chloride levels is frequently observed in critically ill patients, yet its clinical significance remains subject to debate. This study endeavors to explore the relationship between serum chloride levels and in-hospital mortality among patients affected by both congestive heart failure and diabetes. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on adult patients in the United States. The impact of serum chloride levels upon ICU admission on in-hospital mortality was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models, generalized additive models and subgroup analysis. The study encompassed 7,063 patients with coexisting diabetes and congestive heart failure. The fully adjusted model revealed an inverse association between serum chloride levels and in-hospital mortality. As a tertile variable (Q3 vs Q1), the odds ratio (OR) was 0.73 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.54-0.98 (p\u2009=\u20090.039). As a continuous variable, per 1\u00a0mmol/L increment, the OR (95% CI) was 0.97 (0.96-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.01). The relationship between serum chloride and in-hospital mortality demonstrated linearity (non-linear p\u2009=\u20090.958). Stratified analyses further validated the robustness of this correlation. Serum chloride levels exhibited a negative association with in-hospital mortality in patients with both congestive heart failure and diabetes.

        "AbstractText": "Prior research has yielded mixed results regarding the impact of acarbose intake on glycemic markers. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compile data from various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of acarbose intake on fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in adults. To identify relevant literature up to April 2023, a comprehensive search was conducted on various scholarly databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The effect size of the studies was evaluated using a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2. This systematic review and meta-analysis included a total of 101 RCTs with a total of 107 effect sizes. The effect sizes for FBS in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), insulin in picomoles per liter (pmol/l), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in percentage (%), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were 92, 46, 80, and 22, respectively. The pooled analysis indicated that acarbose intake resulted in significant decreases in FBS (p\u2009=\u20090.018), insulin (p\u2009<\u20090.001), HbA1c (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and HOMA-IR (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that acarbose intake can potentially lead to significant improvements in glycemic parameters by decreasing the levels of FBS, HbA1c, and insulin.

The characterization of isolated exosomes and their internalization into MCF-7 cells was evaluated. The treatment of MCF-7 cells with exosomes isolated from different groups was done. Migration, the activity of MMP-2, mRNA expression of Bax and Bcl-2, protein expression of p-53 and Thr55 p-p53, and apoptosis were assessed. Isolated exosomes from unhealthy obese individuals increase MCF-7 cell migration. Regarding MMP activities, unhealthy normal weight and overweight and healthy obese groups isolated exosomes increase the MMP-2 activity than the treated group with exosomes isolated from counterpart groups. Furthermore, unhealthy normal weight and overweight and healthy obese obtained exosomes decrease apoptosis compared to counterpart groups. Altogether, plasma exosomes derived from both unhealthy individuals with normal weight and overweight status, as well as those with unhealthy obesity, negatively impacted the behavior of estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer cells.

        "AbstractText": "Two decades after the Rotterdam 2003 consensus workshop, there have been considerable advances in elucidating the pathophysiology and epidemiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This has prompted the re-examination of the features that characterise this common condition. Current definitions have led to great heterogeneity in the prevalence of PCOS and have contributed to inconsistent treatment protocols and assessment of therapeutic outcomes. Diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of universal agreement on threshold cut-offs for ovarian dysfunction and ethnic differences in hirsutism; both of which are key features in the definitions that are commonly used currently. These challenges often result in dissatisfaction with medical care among PCOS patients and their physicians. Our factor analysis mathematically identified anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), associated polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) and serum testosterone as the only significant cluster associated with menstrual cycle length variability. As such, we propose a simplified criteria wherein the presence of at least 2 of the 3 features below would be sufficient to define PCOS: (1) chronic oligo-ovulation or anovulation as indicated by oligomenorrhea (cycle lengths >35 days) or amenorrhea; (2) PCOM: raised AMH \u226537.0 pmol/L instead of transvaginal ultrasound assessment of ovaries; and (3) Androgen excess, or raised serum androgens above the laboratory reference for women.

Following the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis with appropriate tissue biopsies, prompt treatment with a bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone-based first-line induction with or without daratumumab should be initiated. The goal of treatment is to achieve the best haematologic response possible, ideally with involved free light chain <20 mg/L, as it offers the best chance of organ function improvement. Treatment should be changed if patients do not achieve a partial response within 2 cycles of treatment or very good partial response after 4 cycles or after autologous stem cell transplant, as achievement of profound and prolonged clonal responses translates to better organ response and long-term outcomes.

The objective of the study is to describe the real-world experience of emicizumab in a cohort of adult and paediatric haemophilia A patients in Singapore, including its use in the periprocedural setting. This was an observational study conducted at the 2 main haemophilia treatment centres in Singapore. All haemophilia A patients who commenced treatment with emicizumab before 1 July 2022 were recruited. A total of 18 patients with haemophilia A were included in this study. Ten (55.6%) patients had active inhibitors. The median annual bleeding rate for all patients before emicizumab use was 4.5 events (interquartile range [IQR] 2.8-8.3) compared with 0 events (IQR 0-0) after emicizumab was commenced (P=0). There were no adverse events of venous or arterial thrombosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, or death. A total of 6 procedures in 5 patients were performed during the study period with no major bleeding complications. Emicizumab effectively protects against bleeding in haemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors, including in children less than 12 years old.

Little is known about the experience of Canadian oncology nurses providing cancer care for cancer survivors, as they transition from acute treatment to primary care. This study aimed to (1) explore the experience of oncology nurses dealing with fragmented cancer care for cancer survivors in transition to survivorship; (2) identify oncology nurses' perspectives about what promotes or inhibits their delivery of quality cancer care; and (3) obtain their suggestions to improve cancer care. This study used a phenomenological design to explore the experience of oncology nurses in caring for cancer survivors during transition to survivorship and examine how the nurse participants describe their experience. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data and an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach was used to develop themes from the data. Three oncology nurses participated in this study. The following five themes emerged: (1) Under personal transition: nursing assessment, symptoms management, patient education, resources offered, refusing label of cancer survivors, promoting adjustment to a new normal life, promoting return to work, and recognizing meaning of survivorship; (2) Under cancer survivor's care transition: promoting self-care management, communication, and maximal recovery of body functions; (3) Under nurse's positive experience promoting delivery of quality cancer care: caring for cancer survivors, experience and knowledge, and advocate for cancer survivors; (4) Under barriers that negatively affected delivery of cancer care: low socioeconomic status (especially low income), cultures and languages barriers, and limited time providing nursing care; and (5) Suggestions to improve cancer care: establishing a new position - primary nurse, increasing the number of healthcare professionals, and improving knowledge, skills, and experience. Oncology nurses' knowledge and experience provide a good foundation for quality cancer care and contribute to the health and wellbeing of cancer survivors.",

        "AbstractText": "Contemporary cancer care approaches, such as value- and strengths-based health care, involve integrating patients' needs and preferences, as the cancer experience unfolds. Distinct cancer information-seeking behaviours among patients are increasingly found to influence patient-provider communication, treatment-related decision-making, health processes and outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction with cancer care services. My program of research has already documented diverse cancer information-seeking profiles (CISP) among patients. These profiles can easily be captured by a theory-driven and empirically sound self-report single-item measure presented herein. Guided by Self-Evaluation Theory (SET) - which posits that individuals vary in their motivation to seek information about the self - quantitative work established that SET motives could be reproduced in health-related contexts (N = 600). Qualitative inquiry subsequently explored information-seeking among individuals with various cancer diagnoses. Based on this series of studies, a CIPS measure (containing a general question which prompts individuals to choose the most representative statement based on five descriptions of distinct informational profiles) was tested in a large sample of individuals with diverse cancers. In this latter sample (N = 2,142), patients were administered the CISP and the Ambulatory Oncology Patient Satisfaction Survey (AOPSS). The most frequently reported CISP was complementary (50.2%, i.e., search for cancer information that added to what patients already knew), followed by minimal (25.2%, i.e., no search for cancer information), then guarded (14.4%, i.e., avoiding negative and only seeking hopeful cancer information), peer-focused (6.4%, i.e., search for cancer information from similar others), and last, intense (3.8%, i.e., seeking as much cancer information as possible). These profiles were also differentially related to care satisfaction with intense profiles being the least satisfied across all cancer care domains. The CISP measure can readily assess patients' profiles in the search for (or avoidance of) information about their cancer so that more personalized interventions can be provided. Future research exploring how CISP evolves, as the cancer experience unfolds, is also worthy of further study.",

Here we show that \u03b1SMA localizes to the nucleus in wildtype (WT) smooth muscle cells (SMCs), enriches in the nucleus with SMC differentiation, and associates with chromatin remodeling complexes and SMC contractile gene promotors. The ACTA2 p.R179 \u03b1SMA variant shows decreased nuclear localization. Primary SMCs from Acta2 SMC-R179C/+ mice are less differentiated than WT SMCs in vitro and in vivo and have global changes in chromatin accessibility. Induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with ACTA2 p.R179 variants fail to fully differentiate from neuroectodermal progenitor cells to SMCs, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of an ACTA2 p.R179H patient's aortic tissue show increased SMC plasticity. Thus, nuclear \u03b1SMA participates in SMC differentiation, and loss of this nuclear activity occurs with ACTA2 p.R179 pathogenic variants.",

The worldwide incidence of GC is increasing at a young age. In view of the limited Indian publication, we sought to characterize clinicopathological parameters and risk factors in the adolescents and young adults (AYA) population. Retrospective data from six centers (which are part of the Network of Oncology Clinical Trials in India) from 2015 to 2020 were collected from patient (18-39 years of age) records. This study was approved by the institutional ethical committee of individual centers. All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS (Version 20). Data interpretation along with the analysis of obtained results was carried out using the following tests: Qualitative data was expressed in terms of frequency/percentage. One-hundred fifty-two AYA GC patients were enrolled. The 31 to 39 years age group was most affected in which 76.3% were females. The majority of patients were nonalcoholic (93.4%), nonsmokers (98.0%), and without a family history (98.0%). The most common (MC) presenting symptom was abdominal pain (67.1%). MC site was antrum (48%). Among esophagogastric junction cancers, the majority were type I and II Siewert classifications (77% [20/26] patients in cardia), MC histology-signet ring cell (67.1%) followed by diffuse-type (65.1%).

        "AbstractText": "S. Shanthala Immunophenotypic discordance of receptors between primary and metastatic sites significantly impacts treatment outcomes. Current international guidelines recommend rebiopsy of accessible metastatic lesions to reassess tissue biomarkers. While existing literature on biomarker changes is conflicting and heterogeneous, similar studies on the Indian cohort of breast cancer patients are lacking. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the frequencies of biomarker changes between biopsies from primary and recurrent sites, and their association with various clinicopathological characteristics, including the type of metastasis and treatment in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. This is an ambispective study performed at a single center. Immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of paired primary and recurrence samples of MBC patients was reviewed for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. Concordance, loss, and gain of receptors were assessed based on the Allred scores for ER, PR, and HER2. Ki-67 was assessed based on a 14% cutoff. Further, receptor changes were studied in relation to age, menopausal status, morphology, grade, stage, metastatic sites, interval between biopsies, and treatment. At progression, biopsies were obtained from 41.18% of locoregional recurrence and 58.82% of metastatic sites. Despite high discordance of 47% for ER and 68.6% for PR, true receptor conversion was observed in 9.8%, 21.56%, and 5.88% for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. There was a significant correlation between age and ER discordance ( p \u2009=\u20090.029). Loss in PR significantly correlated with a gain in Ki-67. Of all the metastatic sites, the lung was significantly associated with PR and Ki-67 concordance ( p \u2009=\u20090.008 and p \u2009=\u20090.0425, respectively). Discordance of receptors was neither related to the sites of biopsy (local recurrence or metastatic site) nor to the time interval between biopsies, prior chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. In conclusion, metastatic progression of the disease is accompanied by age-dependent discordance of ER. Unparalleled changes in PR in relation to ER suggest that ER-independent pathways may influence PR expression in MBC. Furthermore, the concurrence of PR loss with Ki-67 gain indicates an aggressive phenotype with disease progression. Hence, follow-up testing of samples for receptor expression is beneficial in determining prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions.",

The prognosis remains unfavorable despite treatment, resulting in higher mortality rates. Early stage carcinoma of the tongue is a distinct entity and is primarily treated with either surgery or radiotherapy. Various factors have been implicated in the prognosis of early stage tongue carcinomas. The main objective of this study is to access whether the lymphocytic host response (LHR) and other prognostic factors influence the survival. Patients and Methods \u2003The data of 129 patients with Stage I and Stage II (T1-2, N0) tongue cancer treated in our institute from January 2012 to December 2016 were retrospectively abstracted from the hospital case records. The various clinical and pathological factors were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier model was used for survival analysis. The disease-free survival (DFS) and the overall survival (OS) with respect to stage and LHR were calculated. Results \u2003On multivariate analysis, site of lesion, comorbidities, habits, grade of the tumor, perineural infiltration (PNI) did not influence the survival. The main factor which was found to be significant in DFS was LHR. The DFS was better for the patients who had lymphocytic infiltration of \u2265 70% (strong LHR) when compared with <70%(weak LHR) ( p \u2009=\u20090.037). The OS with respect to stage ( p \u2009=\u20090.608) and LHR ( p \u2009=\u20090.164) was not found to be statistically significant.

Various ALKi agents are available; however, not all eligible patients receive treatment with them due to various reasons. Given the limited real-world data available in our country, we aimed to assess treatment outcomes through a multicenter collaboration. This retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted under the Network of Oncology Clinical Trials India and included a total of 67 ALK-positive metastatic lung cancer patients from 10 institutes across India, with a median follow-up of 23 months. In the first line setting, the objective response rate (ORR) with ALKi was 63.6% (crizotinib: 60.7%, ceritinib: 70%, alectinib: 66.6%, p \u2009=\u20090.508), while with chemotherapy, it was 26.1%. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for the first line ALKi group was significantly higher than that for chemotherapy (19 vs. 9 months, p \u2009=\u20090.00, hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.54). The mPFS for crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib was 17, 22, and 19 months, respectively ( p \u2009=\u20090.48). Patients who received ALKi upfront or after 1 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy or after 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy had mPFS of 16, 22, and 23 months, respectively ( p \u2009=\u20090.47). ALKi showed superior mPFS compared to chemotherapy in the second line (14 vs. 5 months; p \u2009=\u20090.002) and the third line (20 vs. 4 months; p \u2009=\u20090.009). The median overall survival (OS) was significantly better in patients who received ALKi in any line of therapy (44 vs. 14 months, p \u2009<\u20090.001, HR\u2009=\u20090.10, 95% CI: 0.04-0.23). Brain progression was higher among those who did not receive ALKi (69.2 vs. 31.5%). In conclusion, the use of ALKi as first line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients resulted in improved PFS. PFS and ORR did not significantly differ between patients who received ALKi upfront or after initiating chemotherapy. Notably, patients who received ALKi in second or later lines demonstrated significantly better outcomes compared to those receiving chemotherapy.

The goals of the partnership were to decrease ED utilization through enhanced toxicity management, and to enhance coordination and communication to improve person-centred care. Since 2018, a team of specialized oncology nurses have supported patients across 72 hospitals after hours (e.g., evenings, weekends, and holidays) utilizing evidence-based tele-triage tools including the pan-Canadian Oncology Symptom Triage and Remote Support (COSTaRS) practice guides. Nurses managed most of the calls with self-management strategies and 24% of the callers were referred to the ED. There was an estimated annualized 5,211 ED visits saved, resulting in provincial cost-savings of $3.8 million. Patient experience surveys revealed more than 90% of patients who completed the survey agreed or strongly agreed that they had a good experience with this service and expressed high satisfaction with the quality of the service on all parameters asked.",

Acknowledging the need to address social injustices and health inequities in cancer care for underserved and/or vulnerable populations, CANO/ ACIO convened a national Underserved and Priority Population (UPP) Working Group to create guiding principles and actions related to CANO/ACIO's activities. To support achieving its mandate, the working group hosted a workshop at the 2022 CANO/ACIO Annual Conference where members explored cancer as a social justice issue and the role of nursing advocacy as a tool for advancing social justice in oncology. Video case studies were used to facilitate large and small group discussion, which included an exploration of barriers to advocacy and mitigation strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. Findings from the workshop discussions and post-workshop reflection will be used to inform the ongoing work of the UPP Working Group, which includes creating actionable recommendations for CANO/ACIO's advocacy activities. This work is an important step towards ensuring those affected by cancer have the resources and tools needed to access high-quality care at any point of their cancer journey.",

        "AbstractText": "Advances in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer have paralleled significant developments in the understanding of tumour biology, pathophysiology, and genomics. In spite of this, cancer remains the leading cause of death in Canada, with an estimated two in five Canadians expected to be diagnosed with cancer and one in four Canadians expected to die of cancer in their lifetime. Although Canada has a publicly funded, universal healthcare system, profound inequities exist across the country. Such inequities are often due to a multitude of intersecting factors. The focus of this paper is to review the impact of rurality on cancer care. People residing in rural and remote regions are known to have reduced access to and availability of cancer care, from prevention through diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and palliative care. Potential strategies to mitigate the challenges associated with rurality will be discussed, including an overview of the role that nurses can play in addressing the needs of patients in rural regions. Oncology nurses are well suited to help support patients, their loved ones, and healthcare colleagues in rural settings with a view to helping improve equity in access to care, quality of care, and outcomes of care for all Canadians.",

The scope of competencies of the oncology nurse navigator (ONN) in Canada has evolved over the years in response to emerging cancer care challenges. This integrative review aimed to outline the scope of competencies of the ONN role in Canada. Three databases were searched since its inception to identify Canadian studies or theoretical papers on the role of ONNs. The search yielded 62 articles of which 39 were included in the review. Three interdependent role domains were identified. The first domain of care coordinator highlighted the ONN as a coordinator of health and practical needs along the care journey. The second framed the ONN as a change agent, through increasing patients' health literacy, creating partnerships, and trusting relationships. ONNs were also described as a supporter of wellbeing, or a champion of emotional, multidimensional needs, and a transformer of the context of care. All domains were central to the navigator's success in addressing inequities in care and improving patient outcomes across care settings.",

While receiving active surveillance, patients report anxiety, distress, and depression, yet there is little research capturing the experience of this patient population, nor describing interventions to improve their experience (Damen, 2022).

Of the 30 hospitalized patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme who had died while in hospital, 50% had received support from the palliative care team. Two patients (6.7%) had undergone antineoplastic treatment in the last 14 days of life and 13 (43.3%) had an order limiting invasive measures defined in the last two weeks of life. In half of the patients monitored by a palliative care team, antineoplastic treatment and limitation of invasive measures occurred in the last 14 days of life.

Eighty-eight subjects were recruited in each study arm. Intervention subjects were assessed by a member of the supportive/palliative care team if they had a severity score of >3/10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. Controls received normal care, including discretionary referral. Symptom severity was assessed over the subsequent five months. Data on survival, care setting of death (home, hospice or hospital) and long-term resource use were also collected. Screening led to 141 specialist supportive/palliative care visits in the intervention arm versus only nine in the control arm. There were, however, no subsequent significant differences in symptom severity or the long-term outcomes measured. Many patients identified by the >3/10 severity threshold did not need/want specialist supportive/palliative care referral, and those with severe distress were either identified by the oncology team already or were too unwell or overwhelmed to participate in the study. The specialist service was not overwhelmed. Important considerations on timing and mode of administration of screening tools were revealed. Routine symptom screening can be burdensome for oncology patients and needs to be as simple as possible. Triaging positive screens is an important role for oncology nurses. Investment in training oncology teams to manage uncomplicated distress in the oncology clinic allows for optimal use of scarce supportive/palliative care specialist resources for patients with complex needs.",

However, there is literature to suggest its utility in managing non-painful conditions as well. The focus of this literature review is to provide an overview of indications for SGB for painful and non-painful conditions. We identified published journal articles in the past 25 years from Embase and PubMed databases with the keywords \"cervical sympathetic block, stellate ganglion blocks, cervical sympathetic chain, and cervical sympathetic trunk\". A total of 1556 articles were obtained from a literature search among which 311 articles were reviewed. Among painful conditions, there is a lack of evidence in favor of or against the use of SGB for CRPS despite its common use. SGB can provide postoperative analgesia in selective surgeries and can be effective in temporary pain control of refractory angina and the acute phase of herpes zoster infection. Among non-painful conditions, SGB may have beneficial effects on the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), refractory ventricular arrhythmias, hot flashes in postmenopausal women, and breast cancer-related lymphedema. Additionally, there have been various case reports illustrating the benefits of SGB in the management of cerebral vasospasm, upper limb erythromelalgia, thalamic and central post-stroke pain, palmar hyperhidrosis, orofacial pain, etc. In our review of literature, we found that SGB can be useful in the management of various non-painful conditions beyond the well-known treatment for CRPS, although further studies are required to prove its efficacy.",

In these cohorts, 235 PD cases were ascertained based on a previously validated algorithm combining self-reported information (diagnosis, medication, and symptoms) and registry data. We assigned the following traffic-related exposures to residential addresses at baseline: NO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM)2.5absorbance (as a marker for black carbon exposure), PM with aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5), \u226410 \u00b5m (PM10), PMcoarse (size fraction 2.5-10 \u00b5m), ultrafine particles <0.1 \u00b5m (UFP), and road traffic noise (Lden). Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the associations with PD, adjusted for possible confounders. Both single- and two-pollutant models indicated associations between exposure to NOx, road traffic noise, and increasing odds of developing PD. Odds ratios of fully adjusted two-pollutant models in the highest compared with the lowest exposure quartile were 1.62 (95% CI = 1.02, 2.62) for NOx and 1.47 (95% CI = 0.97, 2.25) for road traffic noise, with clear trends across exposure categories.

Methods \u2003The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to identify records that described the use of deep learning to detect lesions or classify images into cancer or noncancer. A modification of Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (mQUADAS-2) tool was developed for this review and was applied to the included studies. Results of reported studies (area under curve [AUC] of receiver operator curve [ROC] curve, sensitivity, specificity) were recorded. Results \u2003A total of 12,123 records were screened, of which 107 fit the inclusion criteria. Training and test datasets, key idea behind model architecture, and results were recorded for these studies. Based on mQUADAS-2 assessment, 103 studies had high risk of bias due to nonrepresentative patient selection. Four studies were of adequate quality, of which three trained their own model, and one used a commercial network. Ensemble models were used in two of these. Common strategies used for model training included patch classifiers, image classification networks (ResNet in 67%), and object detection networks (RetinaNet in 67%).

We will employ a mixed-methods design guided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing complex interventions. Our approach will integrate systematic review findings on screening participation interventions, evaluation of the recruitment strategy's feasibility in an Irish context, and the application of behavioural science frameworks. The target population includes individuals over 55 years, either current smokers or those who quit within the last year, who reside in highly deprived areas. This co-designed recruitment strategy will combine evidence-based research, local context understanding, and stakeholder input to develop a solution that is both scientifically robust and tailored to the target population's needs. This patient-centred approach aims to increase the potential for successful implementation of lung cancer screening programs, thereby improving early detection and patient outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The development of trastuzumab is among the most significant cancer drug development projects in the 20th century. Trastuzumab became a gamechanger for the treatment of human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer, with a significant positive impact on disease recurrence and survival. The development of trastuzumab was the beginning of a new era of cancer drug development, which showed us the importance of understanding the molecular pathophysiology and drug mechanism of action. The drug-diagnostic codevelopment model, in which the drug is developed in parallel with a predictive biomarker assay, has had a significant impact on today's cancer drug development, and we are indebted to trastuzumab when it comes to the clinical enrichment trial design. Trastuzumab is not the only drug developed to target the HER2 protein. Over the past few decades, several new HER2 targeted therapies have been developed, including small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). In particular, the ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan seems to pave new avenues when it comes to HER2 targeted treatment not only for breast cancer, but also for gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. With the development of trastuzumab as a reference point, this article will provide a brief summary of the efficacy of HER2 targeted therapy, including testing for HER2 positivity, as it has evolved over the past 25 years.",

        "AbstractText": "Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) comprised of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have found success in modulating antigen (Ag)-specific T cell responses for the treatment multiple immunological diseases. Common methods by which Ags are associated with NPs are through encapsulation and surface conjugation; however, these methods suffer from several limitations, including uncontrolled Ag loading, burst release, and potential immune recognition. To overcome these limitations and study the relationship between NP design parameters and modulation of innate and Ag-specific adaptive immune cell responses, we developed ovalbumin (OVA) protein-PLGA bioconjugate NPs (acNP-OVA). OVA was first modified by conjugation with multiple PLGA polymers to synthesize OVA-PLGA conjugates, followed by precise combination with unmodified PLGA to form acNP-OVA with well-defined Ag loadings, reduced burst release, and reduced antibody recognition. Expression of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) increased as a function of acNP-OVA Ag loading. NanoString studies using BMDCs showed that PLGA NPs generally induced anti-inflammatory gene expression profiles independent of the Ag delivery method, where S100a9, Sell, and Ppbp were most significantly reduced. Co-culture studies using acNP-OVA-treated BMDCs and OT-II CD4+ T cells revealed that Ag-specific T cell activation, expansion, and differentiation were dependent on Ag loading and formulation parameters. CD25 expression was induced using acNP-OVA with the lowest Ag loading; however, the induction of robust CD4+ T cell proliferative and cytokine responses required acNP-OVA formulations with higher Ag loading, which was supported using a regulatory T cell (Treg) induction assay. The distinct differences in Ag loading required to achieve various T cell responses supported the concept of an Ag loading threshold for Ag-specific immunotherapy. We anticipate this work will help guide NP designs and aid in the future development of NP-based immunotherapies for Ag-specific immunomodulation.",

MS is typically associated with spinal nerve roots and there have been only ~20 reports of cutaneous or subcutaneous MS to-date in humans. In canines, there have only been two reports of MS, both associated with spinal root nerves. In this report, we describe a 7-year-old Weimaraner cross breed dog that presented with two pigmented lesions on the eyelids. The lesions were surgically removed and histological analysis revealed well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated, expansile, neoplasms that were displacing most of the dermis and adnexa. The first lesion was composed of spindloid cells arranged in short interlacing streams with large amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm that sometimes contained fine melanin granules. In areas there were spindle cells arranged in verocay bodies which led to a diagnosis of MS. In contrast, the second lesion was composed of polygonal cells arranged in thick sheets with large amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm that sometimes contained fine melanin granules. The diagnosis was melanocytoma (which is one of the macroscopic differential diagnoses for MS). Whilst melanocytoma is a commonly occurring cutaneous lesion in canines and surgical removal is considered curative, due to little being known about MS in dogs, the outcome remained guarded, as MS in humans has an unpredictable nature, and recurrence and metastasis have been reported.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated death. Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy plays a critical role in HCC tumorigenesis, metastasis, and prognosis. Choline is an essential nutrient related to prolonged survival and reduced risk of HCC. However, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon is mediated by autophagy. Two HCC cell lines (HUH-7 and Hep3B) were used in the present study. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), colony formation, and in vivo mouse xenografts assays. Cell motility was calculated by wound healing and transwell assays. Autophagosomes were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and autophagy flux was detected by mRFP-GFP-labeled LC3 protein. The mRNA level of genes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels were detected by Western blotting (WB). We found that choline inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by downregulating autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Upregulated expression of the solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7), a specific choline transporter, correlated with better HCC prognosis. We further discovered that choline could promote SLC5A7 expression, upregulate cytoplasm p53 expression to impair the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and attenuate autophagy. Finally, we found that choline acted synergistically with sorafenib to attenuate HCC development in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide novel insights into choline-mediated autophagy in HCC, providing the foothold for its future application in HCC treatment.",

Several ICIs have been unprecedentedly approved as the treatment regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recent decade. Meanwhile, numerous clinical trials are being performed to exploit more ICIs into initially unresectable HCC and postoperative HCC to expectantly induce adequate tumor downstaging for further resection or implement adjuvant treatment for relapse-free survival, respectively. In this review, we aim to summarize some pragmatic histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular pathologic parameters which promisingly indicate the response of neoadjuvant/conversion ICI-related therapy and predict the efficacy of adjuvant/therapeutic ICI-related therapy for HCC. We searched PubMed using the terms hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune checkpoint blockade, conversion therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, biomarker, pathologic evaluation, pathologic assessment till February 2023. Although there is no consensus regarding the pathologic evaluation of relevant HCC specimens, it is encouraging that a few of studies have concentrated on this field, and moreover, the methods and parameters noted on other cancer types are also worthy of reference. For the pathologic assessment of HCC specimens underwent immunotherapy, a suitable sampling scheme, identifying immunotherapy-related pathologic response, and quantification of pathologic response rate should be emphasized. For the patients of HCC who are scheduled to receive immunotherapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structure, programmed cell death ligand 1, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, microsatellite instability and mismatch repair, tumor mutational burden and tumor neoantigen, as well as some other signaling pathways are the potential predictive biomarkers of treatment response of ICI. The management of HCC in the era of immunotherapy arises a brand-new pathological challenge that is to provide an immunotherapy-related diagnostic report. Albeit many related researches are preclinical or insufficient, they may tremendously alter the immunotherapy strategy of HCC in future.",

        "AbstractText": "The application of Pringle maneuver (PM) during hepatectomy reduces intraoperative blood loss and the need for perioperative transfusion, but its effect on long-term recurrence and survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We sought to determine the association between the application of PM and post-hepatectomy oncologic outcomes for patients with HCC. Patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC at 9 Chinese hospitals from January 2010 to December 2018 were identified. Using two propensity score methods [propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW)], cumulative recurrence rate and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) were compared between the patients in the PM and non-PM groups. Multivariate competing-risks regression models were performed to adjust for the effect of non-cancer-specific mortality and other prognostic risk factors. Of the 2,798 included patients, 2,404 and 394 did and did not adopt PM (the PM and non-PM groups), respectively. The rates of intraoperative blood transfusion, postoperative 30-day mortality and morbidity were comparable between the two groups (all P>0.05). In the PSM cohort by the 1:3 ratio, compared to 382 patients in the non-PM group, 1,146 patients in the PM group also had the higher cumulative 5-year recurrence rate and CSM (63.9% and 39.1% vs. 55.3% and 31.6%, both P<0.05). Similar results were also yielded in the entire cohort and the IPTW cohort. Multivariate competing-risks regression analyses demonstrated that no application of the PM was independently associated with lower recurrence rate and CSM based on various analytical cohorts [hazard ratio (HR), 0.82 and 0.77 in the adjusted entire cohort, HR 0.80 and 0.73 in the PSM cohort, and HR 0.80 and 0.76 in the IPTW cohort, respectively]. The findings suggested that no application of PM during hepatectomy for patients with HCC reduced the risk of postoperative recurrence and cancer-specific death by approximately 20-25%.",

        "AbstractText": "Intestinal homeostasis is maintained by specialized host cells and the gut microbiota. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is essential for gastrointestinal development and homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in inflammation and colorectal cancer. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in regulating host-microbial interactions in health and disease. Here, we aim to demonstrate that intestinal Axin1 determines gut homeostasis and host response to inflammation. Axin1 expression was analyzed in human inflammatory bowel disease datasets. To explore the effects and mechanism of intestinal Axin1 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and colitis, we generated new mouse models with Axin1 conditional knockout in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC; Axin1 \u0394IEC) and Paneth cell (PC; Axin1 \u0394PC) to compare with control (Axin1 LoxP; LoxP: locus of X-over, P1) mice. We found increased Axin1 expression in the colonic epithelium of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Axin1 \u0394IEC mice exhibited altered goblet cell spatial distribution, PC morphology, reduced lysozyme expression, and enriched Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila). The absence of intestinal epithelial and PC Axin1 decreased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in vivo. Axin1 \u0394IEC and Axin1 \u0394PC mice became more susceptible to DSS-colitis after cohousing with control mice. Treatment with A. muciniphila reduced DSS-colitis severity. Antibiotic treatment did not change the IEC proliferation in the Axin1 Loxp mice. However, the intestinal proliferative cells in Axin1 \u0394IEC mice with antibiotic treatment were reduced compared with those in Axin1 \u0394IEC mice without treatment. These data suggest non-colitogenic effects driven by the gut microbiome. In conclusion, we found that the loss of intestinal Axin1 protects against colitis, likely driven by epithelial Axin1 and Axin1-associated A. muciniphila. Our study demonstrates a novel role of Axin1 in mediating intestinal homeostasis and the microbiota. Further mechanistic studies using specific Axin1 mutations elucidating how Axin1 modulates the microbiome and host inflammatory response will provide new therapeutic strategies for human IBD.",

Metastasis develops from cancer cells that invade the stromal tissue and intravasate the circulatory or lymphatic systems to eventually form new tumors in other organs. Blocking cancer cell invasion can potentially prevent or reduce the metastatic progression of cancers. Testing different chemical compounds against cell invasion in three-dimensional cultures is a common laboratory technique. The efficacy of the treatments is often evaluated from confocal microscopic images of the cells using image processing. However, the analysis approaches are often subject to variations and inconsistencies due to user decisions that must be made while processing each image. To overcome this limitation, we developed a fully automated method to quantify the invasion of cancer cells from a 3D tumor spheroid into the surrounding extracellular matrix. We demonstrated that this method resolves cell invasion from spheroids of different shapes and sizes and from cells that invade as a cluster or individually. We also showed that this approach can help quantify the dose-dependent anti-invasive effects of a commonly used chemotherapy drug. Our automated method significantly reduces the time and increases the consistency and accuracy of cancer cell invasion analysis in three-dimensional cultures.",

The patient presented with paraesthesia and gradually progressive distal muscle weakness in the left upper limb. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed preganglionic changes in segments C8-D1. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing mass with irregular margins in the left paravertebral region encasing the subclavian artery, pre- and post-ganglionic C6-D1 nerve roots and trunks of the brachial plexus. Using an anterior transclavicular approach the tumour was decompressed, which led to a major improvement in paraesthesia and partial motor recovery. He was doing well at 6 months of follow-up.

Functional MRI and PET parameters were assessed for their diagnostic accuracy for tumour regression grade (TRG). Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to determine the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the sensitivity and specificity of each quantile cut-off. A total of 31 patients were recruited, of whom 20 completed study protocol. All patients included had mid or lower rectal tumours. There were 16 patients (80%) with node-positive disease at presentation. The median time to surgery was 75.5 days (range 52-106 days).

We compared the detection rates and semi-quantitative parameters between [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11PET/CT and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. A total of 72 lesions were detected. Detection rates of DTC and RAIR-DTC by [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were lower than those by 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (60.00% vs. 90.00%, P\u2009=\u2009.004; 59.38% vs. 96.88%). Compared with DTC, RAIR-DTC had higher semi-quantitative parameters of 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. There was no significant difference in semi-quantitative parameters of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT between DTC and RAIR-DTC. Immunohistochemistry showed a significantly higher PSMA expression for RAIR-DTC than for DTC. However, there was no significant correlation between PSMA expression and SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT can detect thyroid cancer metastases but its detection rate was lower than that of 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. There was a difference in PSMA expression levels between DTC and RAIR-DTC, but the difference was not reflected on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT has potential value in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT could screen out patients who may benefit from PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Integrated re-analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets reveals potential mechanisms for Zika viral-based oncolytic therapy in neuroblastoma.",
        "AbstractText": "Paediatric neuroblastoma and brain tumours account for a third of all childhood cancer-related mortality. High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. The Zika virus (ZIKV) can access the nervous system and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma. Here, we perform extensive data mining, integration and re-analysis of ZIKV infection datasets to highlight molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We collate infection data of multiple neuroblastoma cell lines by different ZIKV strains from a body of published literature to inform the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating published transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we propose the involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection. Through data mining of published literature, we observed most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines to be highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and propose the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain to be the most promising candidate for neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV infection is dependent on sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism and mammalian translocon. Our work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.",

        "AbstractText": "An extended length of stay following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) is associated with increased patient morbidity and health care costs. The primary purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for an extended length of stay following ORIF for PHF. All patients who underwent ORIF for PHF between 2015 and 2021 were queried from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and postoperative complications within 30 days of procedure were collected. Extended length of stay (eLOS) was defined by \u2265 3 days from operation to discharge. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of eLOS following ORIF. Characteristics of patients significantly associated with eLOS included age \u2265 75 years (p < .001), male gender (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 (P\u00a0= .001), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification \u2265 3 (P < .001), dependent functional status (P < .001), noninsulin-dependent diabetes (P\u00a0= .037), insulin-dependent diabetes (P < .001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < .001), congestive heart failure (CHF) (P < .001), hypertension (P < 0.001), dialysis (P < .013), disseminated cancer (P < 0.001), chronic steroid use (P\u00a0= .004), and bleeding disorder (P < .001). Independent predictors of eLOS were age \u2265 75 years (OR\u00a0= 2.69; P < .001), BMI < 18.5 (OR\u00a0= 1.70; P\u00a0= .016), ASA \u2265 3 (OR\u00a0= 2.70; P < .001), dependent functional status (OR\u00a0= 2.30; P < .001), CHF (OR\u00a0= 3.57; P < .001), disseminated cancer (OR\u00a0= 7.62; P < .001), and bleeding disorder (OR\u00a0= 2.68; P < .001). Age \u2265 75, BMI < 18.5, ASA \u2265 3, functional dependence, CHF, disseminated cancer, and bleeding disorder were independently associated with eLOS. Assessing specific patient factors prior to ORIF for PHF can assist in managing perioperative risks and decreasing expenses related to eLOS. Prognosis III.",

We conducted a scoping review guided by the question: \"How are cultural or social representations in the context of breast cancer described in the global scientific Public Health production?\". We searched for works in five scientific literature sources and included 45 studies. The analytical process followed the content analysis technique in the thematic modality. The analyzed collection can be thematized into the following categories: (1) Compromised body image and interactions, (2) Spirituality, (3) Loss of control over life, (4) Going on with life, and (5) Association with ethnic-racial issues. Despite advances in biomedicine, we observed that representations of breast cancer still have metaphors associated with cancer in the last century. We conclude that, among other aspects, care for women with breast cancer cannot be guided only by biomedical and epidemiological approaches since this disease is traversed by knowledge that competes with these approaches.

We conducted a time series analysis (2010-2019) of performance indicators across the following dimensions based on an adapted conceptual framework: health service performance, health system, and determinants of health. Annual percentage change was calculated for each indicator using a log-linear model. Performance across the indicators was generally positive; however, there was a decline in performance across indicators of quality of care (congenital syphilis, cesarean section rate and cervical cancer screening). The findings also show a potential rise in demand for public services (due to population aging and a reduction in the percentage of the population with private health insurance) and increase in health expenditure against a backdrop of falling GDP per capita.

A cross-sectional study was conducted using cervical cancer cases in women aged 18 to 99 years, from 2006 to 2015, extracted from the Hospital Cancer Registry (HCR) Integrator. Contextual variables were collected from the Atlas of Human Development in Brazil; the National Registry of Health Institutions (NRHI); and the Outpatient Information System. Multilevel Poisson Regression with random intercept was used. The prevalence of advanced stage diagnosis was 48.4%, revealing an association with older age groups (PR 1.06; CI 1.01-1.10), black, brown, and indigenous race/skin color (PR 1.04; CI 1.01-1.07), lower levels of schooling (PR 1.28; CI 1.16-1.40), no marital partner (PR 1.10; CI 1.07-1.13), public referral to the health service (PR 1.07; CI 1.03-1.11), and lower rates of cytological examination (PR 1.08; CI 1.01-1.14).

        "AbstractText": "Young adults are generally hard to survey, presenting researchers with numerous difficulties. They are hard to locate and contact due to high mobility. They are hard to persuade and exhibit high levels of resistance to survey participation. As a result, they pose a greater challenge for longitudinal surveys. This paper explores the role of mode of data collection in young adults' decisions to stay in a longitudinal panel. We draw on data from the National Young Adult Health Survey (NYAHS). NYAHS is a longitudinal study (three annual waves and 2 brief between-wave follow-up surveys) of adults aged 18-34 initially recruited in 2019 through RDD sampling of cell phone numbers nationwide. All sampled cell phone numbers were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions; the conditions differed in mode of data collection used in subsequent interviews once screened in. In the first condition, young adults continue all rounds of interviews by telephone (\"telephone only\" condition). The second group of young adults completed one round of interview by web and the rest by telephone (\"telephone mostly\" condition). The last third was asked to complete three interviews online and two interviews by telephone (\"web mostly\" condition). We examined the impact of mode switching on young adults' likelihood of participating in later surveys and on nonresponse bias in key survey outcomes. We found that switching young adults from telephone to web had an immediate negative effect on their likelihood of participating in that web survey, but it did not have a continued negative effect. Switching them from web to telephone increased response rates and reduced nonresponse bias. The findings have important practical implications on how to survey young adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Immunotherapy is becoming a promising approach for unresectable-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); the anti-tumor response is affected by the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations are reported to cause non-inflamed phenotype, their role on TME remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the heterogeneity of immunophenotype in HCC with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. This study includes 152 resected HCCs; mutations in the catenin beta-1, adenomatous polyposis coli, or AXIN1, or AXIN2 genes were defined as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. With hierarchical cluster analyses, TME was classified into inflamed or non-inflamed classes based on the gene expressions associated with T-cell activation. Expression profiles of molecules related to cell differentiation and biliary-stem cell markers were compared between the TME classes to investigate whether differences in tumor traits were associated with TME. Forty of 152 (26.3%) HCCs carried the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. Of these, 33 were classified as non-inflamed (33/40, 82.5%) and 7 as inflamed (7/40, 17.5%). Non-inflamed class was characterized by low number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells on immunostaining, and high mRNA expressions of AXIN2 and GLUL, which are involved in the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and hepatocyte differentiation, respectively. Non-inflamed tumors showed higher enhancement on the hepatobiliary-phase of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to inflamed tumors. HCCs classified as inflamed class are revealed to have high numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on immunostaining. This class is associated with increased expression of anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule and FOXM1 accompanied by upregulation of genes related to interferon-gamma signaling, dendritic cell migration, regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation and recognized as low enhancement nodule on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Heterogeneity of tumor traits and TME was observed in HCC with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutation. The potential was indicated that tumor traits and TME are determined not only by the activation of the HNF4A but also by FOXM1, both of which are downstream transcription factor of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "The phase III REFLECT trial demonstrated that lenvatinib was superior to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, and objective response rate (ORR) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of preoperative lenvatinib therapy for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC. In this multicenter single-arm phase II trial, patients with advanced HCC and factors suggestive of a poor prognosis (macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic metastasis, or multinodular tumors) were enrolled. Patients with these factors, even with technically resectable HCC, were defined as oncologically unresectable because of the expected poor prognosis after surgery. After 8 weeks of lenvatinib therapy, the patients were assessed for resectability, and tumor resection was performed if the tumor was considered technically resectable. The primary endpoint was the surgical resection rate. The secondary endpoints were the macroscopic curative resection rate, overall survival (OS), ORR, PFS, and the change in the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min as measured before and after lenvatinib therapy. The trial was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057). Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients (42 oncologically unresectable patients and 7 technically unresectable patients) from 11 centers were enrolled. The ORR was 37.5% based on mRECIST and 12.5% based on RECIST version 1.1. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery (surgical resection rate: 67.3%) without perioperative mortality. The surgical resection rate was 76.2% for oncologically unresectable patients and 14.3% for technically unresectable patients. The 1-year OS rate and median PFS were 75.9% and 7.2 months, respectively, with a median follow-up period of 9.3 months. The relatively high surgical resection rate seen in this study suggests the safety and feasibility of lenvatinib therapy followed by surgical resection for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC.",

However, the optimal second-line therapy after treatment failure of first-line ICI-based therapy remains unknown as no RCT has examined this issue. Therefore, at present, most clinicians are empirically treating patients with TKIs or retrial of ICI or locoregional treatment (LRT) modality such as transarterial therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy in this clinical setting without solid evidence. In this review, we will discuss current optimal strategies for second-line treatment after the failure of first-line ICI-based therapy by reviewing published studies and ongoing prospective trials. Clinicians should consider carefully whether to treat the patients with TKI, other ICI-based therapy, or LRT in this situation by considering several factors including liver function reserve, performance status, adverse events of previous therapy, and presence of lesion that can consider LRT such as oligoprogression and vascular invasion. In the meantime, we await the results of ongoing prospective trials to elucidate the best management options.",

Human peripheral blood samples are widely used for RNAseq, providing valuable insights into individual biomolecular information. Blood samples can be classified as whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and remaining sediment samples, including plasma-free blood (PFB) and serum-free blood (SFB) samples that are generally considered less useful byproducts during the processes of plasma and serum separation, respectively. However, the feasibility of using PFB and SFB samples for transcriptome analysis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the suitability of employing PFB or SFB samples as an alternative RNA source in transcriptomic analysis. We performed a comparative analysis of WB, PFB, and SFB samples for different applications. Our results revealed that PFB samples exhibit greater similarity to WB samples than SFB samples in terms of protein-coding gene expression patterns, detection of differentially expressed genes, and immunological characterizations, suggesting that PFB can serve as a viable alternative to WB for transcriptomic analysis.

A detailed understanding of the economics of major pancreatic surgery is limited among many clinicians and hospital administrators. A greater consideration of these financial aspects may in fact have implications for enhancing clinical care and for a broader sustainability of high-volume pancreatic surgery programs. In this retrospective observational study, patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), total pancreatectomy, or distal pancreatectomy at one academic medical center during the fiscal year 2021 were evaluated. Detailed hospital charges and professional fees were obtained for patients using the Qlik perioperative database. Clinical data for the study cohort were gathered from a prospectively maintained, IRB-approved pancreatic surgery database. Charges for the 91-day perioperative period were included. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. During the study period, 159 evaluable patients underwent 1 of 3 designated pancreatic resections included in the analysis. Ninety-seven patients (61%) were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and 70% (n = 110) underwent PD. The total charges (combined professional and hospital charges) for the cohort encompassing the entire perioperative period were $20,661,759. The median charge per patient was $130,306 (interquartile range [IQR], $34,534). The median direct cost of care was $23,219 (IQR, $6321) and the median contribution margin per case was $10,092 (IQR, $22,949). The median surgeon professional fee charges were $7700 per patient (IQR, $1296) as compared to $3453 (IQR, $1,144) for professional fee receipts (45% of the surgeon charge). The differences between the professional fee charges and receipts per patient were also considerable for other health care professionals such as anesthesiologists ($4945 charges vs $1406 receipts [28%]) and pathologists ($3035 charges vs $680 receipts [22%]). The surgeon professional fees were only 6% of the total charges, while the professional fees for anesthesiology and pathology were 4% and 2% of the total charges, respectively. Supply charges were 3% of the total charges. Longer operative time was correlated with increased hospital and anesthesia charges, without a significant increase in surgeon charges (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.2, respectively). Male sex, diabetes, and low serum albumin correlated with greater total hospital charges (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.03, respectively). The role of the surgeon in the perioperative clinical care of major pancreatic resection patients is crucial and important and is by no means limited to the operative day. Nevertheless, in the context of the current US health care system, the reimbursement to the surgeon in the form of professional fees is a relatively small fraction of the total health care receipts for these patients. This imbalance necessitates a substantial financial partnership between hospitals and their pancreatic surgery units to ensure the long-term viability of these programs.",

This paper presents a mixed-integer program for combination chemotherapy (utilization of multiple drugs) optimization that incorporates various important operational constraints and, besides dose and concentration limits, controls treatment toxicity based on its effect on the count of white blood cells. To address the uncertainty of tumor heterogeneity, we also propose chance constraints that guarantee reaching an operable tumor size with a high probability in a neoadjuvant setting. We present analytical results pertinent to the accuracy of the model in representing biological processes of chemotherapy and establish its potential for clinical applications through a numerical study of breast cancer.",

Currently, an ample of amount of research is going on to develop new materials to advance its capabilities and increase its potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel, transparent, printable, photocrosslinkable, and tuneable silicone composite that can be utilized as a support bath or an extrudable ink for embedded printing. Its properties can be tuned to achieve ideal rheological properties, such as optimal self-recovery and yield stress, for use in 3D printing. When used as a support bath, it facilitated the generation microfluidic devices with circular channels of diameter up to 30 \u03bcm. To demonstrate its utility, flow focusing microfluidic devices were fabricated for generation of Janus microrods, which can be easily modified for multitude of applications. When used as an extrudable ink, 3D printing of complex-shaped constructs were achieved with integrated electronics, which greatly extends its potential applications towards soft robotics. Further, its biocompatibility was tested with multiple cell types to validate its applicability for tissue engineering. Altogether, this material offers a myriad of potential applications (i.e., soft robotics, microfluidics, bioprinting) by providing a facile approach to develop complicated 3D structures and interconnected channels.",

All rectal cancers should be tested for microsatellite instability prior to treatment decisions. Patients with microsatellite instability are relatively resistant to chemotherapy. However, recent small studies have shown dramatic response with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Patients with Lynch syndrome have a hereditary predisposition to cancer and thus an elevated risk of metachronous cancer. Therefore, while \"watch and wait\" is a well-established practice for sporadic rectal cancers that obtain a complete clinical response after chemoradiation, its safety in patients with Lynch syndrome has not yet been defined. The extent of surgery for patients with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer is controversial and there is significant debate as to the relative advantages of a segmental proctectomy with postoperative endoscopic surveillance versus a therapeutic and prophylactic total proctocolectomy. Surgical decision making for the patient with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer is complex and demands a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account both patient- and tumor-specific factors. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy show great promise in the treatment of these patients, and further maturation of data from prospective trials will likely change the current treatment paradigm. Patients with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer who do not undergo total proctocolectomy require yearly surveillance colonoscopies and should consider chemoprophylaxis with aspirin.",

Today, two predominant radiotherapy approaches-hyperfractionated chemoradiotherapy and \"short-course\" radiation-are widely utilized to reduce local recurrence and, in some cases, cure disease. Both have been incorporated into total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) regimens and achieved excellent local control and superior complete response rates compared to chemoradiation alone. Additionally, initial results of \"watch and wait\" protocols utilizing either radiation modality have been promising. Yet, differences do exist; though short course is cheaper and more convenient for patients, recently published data may show superior complete response and local recurrence rates with chemoradiation.

With recent technological developments in the FUS technology and its monitoring/guided techniques such as ultrasound-guided FUS and magnetic resonance-guided FUS (MRgFUS) the need for TMPs are more important than ever to ensure the safety of the patients before being treated with FUS for a variety of diseases (e.g., cancer or neurological). The purpose of this study was to prepare a tumor-mimicking phantom (TUMP) model that can simulate competently a tumor that is surrounded by healthy tissue. The TUMP models were prepared using polyacrylamide (PAA) and agar solutions enriched with MR contrast agents (silicon dioxide and glycerol), and the thermosensitive component bovine serum albumin (BSA) that can alter its physical properties once thermal change is detected, therefore offering real-time visualization of the applied FUS ablation in the TUMPs models. To establish if these TUMPs are good candidates to be used in thermoablation, their thermal properties were characterized with a custom-made FUS system in the laboratory and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) setup with MR-thermometry. The BSA protein's coagulation temperature was adjusted at 55\u00b0C by setting the pH of the PAA solution to 4.5, therefore simulating the necrosis temperature of the tissue. The experiments carried out showed that the TUMP models prepared by PAA can change color from transparent to cream-white due to the BSA protein coagulation caused by the thermal stress applied. The TUMP models offered a good MRI contrast between the TMPs and the TUMPs including real-time visualization of the ablation area due to the BSA protein coagulation. Furthermore, the T2-weighted MR images obtained showed a significant change in T2 when the BSA protein is thermally coagulated. MR thermometry maps demonstrated that the suggested TUMP models may successfully imitate a tumor that is present in soft tissue. The TUMP models developed in this study have numerous uses in the testing and calibration of FUS equipment including the simulation and validation of thermal therapy treatment plans with FUS or MRgFUS in oncology applications.",

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a scalable natural language processing (NLP)- and radiomics-based machine learning pipeline to differentiate between painless and painful BM lesions in simulation computed tomography (CT) images using imaging features (biomarkers) extracted from lesion center point-based regions of interest (ROIs). Patients treated at our comprehensive cancer center who received palliative radiotherapy for thoracic spine BM between January 2016 and September 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Physician-reported pain scores were extracted automatically from radiation oncology consultation notes using an NLP pipeline. BM center points were manually pinpointed on CT images by radiation oncologists. Nested ROIs with various diameters were automatically delineated around these expert-identified BM center points, and radiomics features were extracted from each ROI. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique resampling, the Least Absolute Shrinkage And Selection Operator feature selection method, and various machine learning classifiers were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Radiation therapy consultation notes and simulation CT images of 176 patients (mean age 66, SD 14 years; 95 males) with thoracic spine BM were included in this study. After BM center point identification, 107 radiomics features were extracted from each spherical ROI using pyradiomics. Data were divided into 70% and 30% training and hold-out test sets, respectively. In the test set, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of our best performing model (neural network classifier on an ensemble ROI) were 0.82 (132/163), 0.59 (16/27), 0.85 (116/136), and 0.83, respectively.

We aimed to develop, test, and validate a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) tool that automatically extracts GGO features to inform the longitudinal trajectory of GGO status from large-scale radiology notes. We developed a bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random field-based deep-learning NLP pipeline to extract GGO and granular features of GGO retrospectively from radiology notes of 13,216 lung cancer patients. We evaluated the pipeline with quality assessments and analyzed cohort characterization of the distribution of nodule features longitudinally to assess changes in size and solidity over time. Our NLP pipeline built on the GGO ontology we developed achieved between 95% and 100% precision, 89% and 100% recall, and 92% and 100% F1-scores on different GGO features. We deployed this GGO NLP model to extract and structure comprehensive characteristics of GGOs from 29,496 radiology notes of 4521 lung cancer patients. Longitudinal analysis revealed that size increased in 16.8% (240/1424) of patients, decreased in 14.6% (208/1424), and remained unchanged in 68.5% (976/1424) in their last note compared to the first note. Among 1127 patients who had longitudinal radiology notes of GGO status, 815 (72.3%) were reported to have stable status, and 259 (23%) had increased/progressed status in the subsequent notes.

The Portuguese Directorate-General of Health developed a deep neural network, AUTOCOD, which determines the primary causes of death by analyzing the free text of physicians' death certificates (DCs). Although AUTOCOD's performance has been established, it remains unclear whether its performance remains consistent over time, particularly during periods of excess mortality. This study aims to assess the sensitivity and other performance metrics of AUTOCOD in classifying underlying causes of death compared with manual coding to identify specific causes of death during periods of excess mortality. We included all DCs between 2016 and 2019. AUTOCOD's performance was evaluated by calculating various performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score, using a confusion matrix. This compared International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), classifications of DCs by AUTOCOD with those by human coders at the Directorate-General of Health (gold standard). Subsequently, we compared periods without excess mortality with periods of excess, severe, and extreme excess mortality. We defined excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score above the 95% baseline limit, severe excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score >4 SDs, and extreme excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score >6 SDs. Finally, we repeated the analyses for the 3 most common ICD-10 chapters focusing on block-level classification. We analyzed a large data set comprising 330,098 DCs classified by both human coders and AUTOCOD. AUTOCOD demonstrated high sensitivity (\u22650.75) for 10 ICD-10 chapters examined, with values surpassing 0.90 for the more prevalent chapters (chapter II-\"Neoplasms,\" chapter IX-\"Diseases of the circulatory system,\" and chapter X-\"Diseases of the respiratory system\"), accounting for 67.69% (223,459/330,098) of all human-coded causes of death. No substantial differences were observed in these high-sensitivity values when comparing periods without excess mortality with periods of excess, severe, and extreme excess mortality. The same holds for specificity, which exceeded 0.96 for all chapters examined, and for PPV, which surpassed 0.75 in 9 chapters, including the more prevalent ones. When considering block classification within the 3 most common ICD-10 chapters, AUTOCOD maintained a high performance, demonstrating high sensitivity (\u22650.75) for 13 ICD-10 blocks, high PPV for 9 blocks, and specificity of >0.98 in all blocks, with no significant differences between periods without excess mortality and those with excess mortality. Our findings indicate that, during periods of excess and extreme excess mortality, AUTOCOD's performance remains unaffected by potential text quality degradation because of pressure on health services. Consequently, AUTOCOD can be dependably used for real-time cause-specific mortality surveillance even in extreme excess mortality situations.",

This is a retrospective study applying a commercial AI CAD system (Insight MMG, version 1.1.4.3; Lunit Inc) to a cancer-enriched mammography screening data set of 10,889 women (median age 56, range 40-74 years). The AI CAD generated a continuous prediction score for tumor suspicion between 0.00 and 1.00, where 1.00 represented the highest level of suspicion. A binary read (flagged or not flagged) was defined on the basis of a predetermined cutoff threshold (0.40). The flagged median and proportion of AI scores were calculated for women who were healthy, those who had a benign biopsy finding, and those who were diagnosed with breast cancer. For women with a benign biopsy finding, the interval between mammography and the biopsy was used for stratification of AI scores. The effect of increasing age was examined using subgroup analysis and regression modeling. Of a total of 10,889 women, 234 had a benign biopsy finding before or after screening. The proportions of flagged healthy women were 3.5%, 11%, and 84% for healthy women without a benign biopsy finding, those with a benign biopsy finding, and women with breast cancer, respectively (P<.001). For the 8307 women with complete information, radiologist 1, radiologist 2, and the AI CAD system flagged 8.5%, 6.8%, and 8.5% of examinations of women who had a prior benign biopsy finding. The AI score correlated only with increasing age of the women in the cancer group (P=.01). Compared to healthy women without a biopsy, the examined AI CAD system flagged a much larger proportion of women who had or would have a benign biopsy finding based on a radiologist's decision. However, the flagging rate was not higher than that for radiologists. Further research should be focused on training the AI CAD system taking prior biopsy information into account.",

        "AbstractText": "Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), a class I HDAC enzyme, is crucial for histone modification. Currently, it is emerged as one of the important biological targets for designing small molecule drugs through cancer epigenetics. Along with synthetic inhibitors different natural inhibitors are showing potential HDAC1 inhibitions. In order to gain insights into the relationship between the molecular structures of the natural inhibitors and HDAC1, different molecular modelling techniques (Bayesian classification, recursive partitioning, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations) have been applied on a dataset of 155 HDAC1 nature-inspired inhibitors with diverse scaffolds. The Bayesian study showed acceptable ROC values for both the training set and test sets. The Recursive partitioning study produced decision tree 1 with 6 leaves. Further, molecular docking study was processed for generating the protein ligand complex which identified some potential amino acid residues such as F205, H28, L271, P29, F150, Y204 for the binding interactions in case of natural inhibitors. Stability of these HDAC1-natutal inhibitors complexes has been also evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation study. The current modelling study is an attempt to get a deep insight into the different important structural fingerprints among different natural compounds modulating HDAC1 inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, there have been no detailed reports about treatment for psychiatric symptoms of delirium associated with Trousseau syndrome. A 61-year-old man with lung cancer was hospitalized due to Trousseau syndrome. Delirium occurred after hospitalization and psychiatric symptoms worsened. Although haloperidol, risperidone, and chlorpromazine were used, severe insomnia persisted. After memantine (5\u2009mg/day) was used with perospirone, the patient's psychiatric symptoms gradually decreased; he could sleep for 4-5\u2009h at night. Due to psychiatric improvement, he was able to return home and resume immunotherapy for lung cancer as scheduled. We report the first case of Trousseau syndrome delirium treated by memantine used with perospirone. Although further studies are needed, memantine and perospirone might be candidates for the management of psychiatric symptoms associated with Trousseau syndrome.",

Derived components from saliva and salivary glands of hard ticks Ixodidae have been characterized as potential natural sources for discovering promising anti-cancer drug candidates. The anti-cancer activity of salivary gland extracts (SGEs) from Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma marginatum, and Hyalomma schulzei was assessed. MTT assays and flow cytometry were done on the HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line to evaluate the anti-viability and proliferative inhibition. Based on the MTT assay results, the SGEs from Hy. dromedarii had the highest and lowest substantial anti-viability effects on the HT-29 cancer cell and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) normal cell, respectively. The cytometric assessment revealed a significant increase in the apoptosis and necrosis ratio of the HT-29 cancer cells after treatment with Hy. dromedarii SGEs. The results demonstrated that Hy. dromedarii SGEs have significant anti-proliferative, anti-viability, and apoptotic potential. The result of this study suggests that Hy. dromedarii SGEs is an appropriate candidate for further investigations to identify and purify the mechanisms and molecules involved in the anti-cancer activity of the SGEs.",

Schemes for ccRCC classification system based on multiomics are urgent, to promote further biological insights. Two hundred and fifty-five\u00a0ccRCC patients with paired data of clinical information, transcriptome expression profiles, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations were collected for identification. Bioinformatic analyses were performed based on our team's recently developed R package \"MOVICS.\"\u00a0With 10 state-of-the-art algorithms, we identified the multiomics subtypes (MoSs) for ccRCC patients. MoS1 is an immune exhausted subtype, presented the poorest prognosis, and might be caused by an exhausted immune microenvironment, activated hypoxia features, but can benefit from PI3K/AKT inhibitors. MoS2 is an immune \"cold\" subtype, which represented more mutation of VHL and PBRM1, favorable prognosis, and is more suitable for sunitinib therapy. MoS3 is the immune \"hot\" subtype, and can benefit from the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We successfully verified the different molecular features of the three MoSs in external cohorts GSE22541, GSE40435, and GSE53573. Patients that received Nivolumab therapy helped us to confirm that MoS3 is suitable for anti-PD-1 therapy. E-MTAB-3267 cohort also supported the fact that MoS2 patients can respond more to sunitinib treatment. We also confirm that SETD2 is a tumor suppressor in ccRCC, along with the decreased SETD2 protein level in advanced tumor stage, and knock-down of\u00a0SETD2 leads to the promotion of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In summary, we provide novel insights into\u00a0ccRCC molecular subtypes based on robust clustering algorithms via multiomics data, and encourage future precise treatment of\u00a0ccRCC patients.",

The patient exhibited an acute confusional state, visual hallucinations, irritability, and cognitive impairments over a 3-week period. Initially, the patient was misdiagnosed with several conditions, including alcohol withdrawal syndrome, psychosis, and delirium associated with dementia, as there were no noteworthy findings on neurological examination or the head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Given the rapidly progressive cognitive decline, we maintained vigilance for potential neurological conditions, and a repeat investigation using head MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis led to the diagnosis of LM.

This in vitro study assessed evorpacept-induced interference at extended concentrations and investigated the capability of a novel mitigation agent, Evo-NR. Antibody screening tests were performed on evorpacept-spiked plasma with (anti-E and anti-Jka) or without alloantibodies at evorpacept concentrations up to 2,000 \u03bcg/mL using manual gel cards and automated analyzers. Evorpacept-coated red blood cells (RBCs) (rr [ce/ce], Fy[a+b-], S-s+) were tested by direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) and antigen typing using anti-Fyb and anti-S reagents at indirect antiglobulin testing (IAT) phase. Evo-NR was used to resolve the interference in plasma and RBC samples. Flow cytometry was used to assess the mitigation effects. Evorpacept-spiked plasma showed panreactive interference in antibody screening tests using manual gel cards (2+ to 3+) and automated analyzers (4+). A carryover effect was also observed in the automated analyzers. The use of a 3- to 6-fold molar excess of Evo-NR effectively resolved the interference in the plasma and enabled accurate alloantibody identification. Although the reduction in evorpacept binding to RBCs was identified via flow cytometry, Evo-NR was incapable of resolving the serologic interference observed in DAT and antigen typing at IAT phase. Evorpacept showed constant panreactivity and a carryover effect at high concentrations. Evo-NR successfully resolved the interference in the plasma samples and could be considered a practical and efficient mitigation solution. Implementation of Evo-NR has the potential to support RBC transfusion for patients undergoing evorpacept treatment.",

Thus, much effort is being put into finding new ways to improve immune checkpoint therapy. Our review concludes that inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which plays a critical role in regulating cholesterol metabolism, can cause movement of T cells toward tumors, with increased sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapies. We searched PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the published articles without limitations on publication dates. We used the following terms: \"PCSK9\", \"Cancer\", \"Immune Checkpoint\", and \"Cancer Prognosis\" in the title and/or abstract. Our search initially revealed 600 records on the subject and stored them in the used databases under EndNote X8 management software. A total of 161 articles were selected and through a careful review, 76 were included in our research. We concluded that PCSK9 reduces the number of LDL receptors (LDL-R) on the cell surface, which is linked to its ability to regulate cholesterol levels in the body. Also, we discuss how suppressing PCSK9 leads to the MHC-1 accumulation on the surface of cancer cells, which results in T lymphocyte invasion. Finally, we believe that inhibiting PCSK9 may be an effective strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy.",

The interaction of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) plays an important role by inhibiting the immune mechanism by which cancer cells escape antitumor immunity. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors is a growing treatment modality in many cancers; one such is anti-PD1/PD-L1. The present study aimed to study the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 in CRC and its association with various known clinicopathological parameters. This study was a 2-year prospective study and included 34 colectomy specimens diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinoma. The expression of PD-L1 was evaluated on tumoral cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and was correlated with various clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 on tumoral cells and tumor microenvironment in CRC revealed positivity in 17.65% of cases each. The PD-L1 expression on tumoral cells was associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) with P- values of 0.012 and 0.005, respectively, while PD-L1 expression on TIICs was associated with tumor budding with a P-value of 0.022. IHC expression of PD-L1 on tumoral cells and immune cells may be associated with some known poor prognostic factors.

Early detection of breast cancer patients who are at risk requires development of a marker. Alfa smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) plays a role in the local recurrence process of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Currently, existing tumor markers are used to predict the prognosis of breast cancer in general, not the early stages.

Participants answered an updated version of a questionnaire used in 1995 by Ljungman et\u00a0al. focusing on the healthcare professionals' experience of pain among their patients, their pain treatment strategies, and need for training. 120 nurses and 65 physicians participated. Fifty percent of nurses and 55% of physicians answered that moderate-to-severe pain was experienced often or very often by children with cancer. Methods recommended in international guidelines to diagnose, evaluate, and treat pain were generally followed. Compared with findings from 1995 by Ljungman et\u00a0al., nurses, and physicians assessed that moderate-to-severe pain was seen more often. The greatest need for training was reported for pharmacology, different routes for administration of opioids, treatment with nitrous oxide, and nonpharmacological interventions. Nurses and physicians assessed that moderate-to-severe pain is often present in children with cancer. More time to treat pain in the department and training in certain areas seem to be needed to improve pain management.",

        "AbstractText": "Mismatch repair deficiency, immunological fertility, and PD-L1 expression status are key histopathological and molecular features defining tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy and, eventually, prognosis. These were investigated in a series of locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density was assessed in hematoxylin-eosin tissue sections. PD-L1 expression and the expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, PSM2, MSH2, and MSH6) were assessed with immunohistochemistry. Their association with histopathological variables (node involvement and tumor budding) and prognosis was assessed. The TIL-density was significantly higher in the invading tumor front and was inversely related to tumor budding and directly with better overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and 0.02, respectively). Cancer cell PD-L1 expression was related to high TIL-density (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not to prognosis, although its overexpression defined a trend for poorer OS in patients with high TIL-density. High PD-L1 expression by stroma infiltrating immune cells was linked with better OS and DMFS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007 and 0.001, respectively. MMR deficiency was recorded in 26.2\u00a0% of cases, and this was linked with higher TIL-density, but not with prognosis. Dense intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration relates to a better prognosis in rectal cancer, although it is also linked with PD-L1 expression that may adversely modulate the anti-tumor effects of TILs. This latter subgroup of patients (high TIL-density/high cancer cell PD-L1 expression) could be an additional target for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, along with the established subgroup of MMR deficient patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Type I interferons are cytokines involved in innate immunity against viruses. Genetic disorders of type I interferon regulation are associated with a range of autoimmune and cerebrovascular phenotypes. Carriers of pathogenic variants involved in genetic disorders of type I interferons are generally considered asymptomatic. Preliminary data suggests, however, that genetically determined dysregulation of type I interferon responses is associated with autoimmunity, and may also be relevant to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We aim to determine whether functional variants in genes involved in type I interferon regulation and signalling are associated with the risk of autoimmunity, stroke, and dementia in a population cohort. We will perform a hypothesis-driven candidate pathway association study of type I interferon-related genes using rare variants in the UK Biobank (UKB). We will manually curate type I interferon regulation and signalling genes from a literature review and Gene Ontology, followed by clinical and functional filtering. Variants of interest will be included based on pre-defined clinical relevance and functional annotations (using LOFTEE, M-CAP and a minor allele frequency <0.1%). The association of variants with 15 clinical and three neuroradiological phenotypes will be assessed with a rare variant genetic risk score and gene-level tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold from the number of genetic units and phenotypes tested. We will explore the association of significant genetic units with 196 additional health-related outcomes to help interpret their relevance and explore the clinical spectrum of genetic perturbations of type I interferon. The UKB has received ethical approval from the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment. This research will be conducted using the UKB Resource under application number 93160.

        "AbstractText": "This work concerns the effective personalized prediction of longitudinal biomarker trajectory, motivated by a study of cancer targeted therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Continuous monitoring with a confirmed biomarker of residual disease is a key component of CML management for early prediction of disease relapse. However, the longitudinal biomarker measurements have highly heterogeneous trajectories between subjects (patients) with various shapes and patterns. It is believed that the trajectory is clinically related to the development of treatment resistance, but there was limited knowledge about the underlying mechanism. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to modeling the distribution of subject-specific longitudinal trajectories. It exploits flexible Bayesian learning to accommodate complex changing patterns over time and non-linear covariate effects, and allows for real-time prediction of both in-sample and out-of-sample subjects. The generated information can help make clinical decisions, and consequently enhance the personalized treatment management of precision medicine.",

        "AbstractText": "mRNA therapeutics have emerged as powerful tools for cancer immunotherapy in accordance with their superiority in expressing all sequence-known proteins in vivo. In particular, with a small dosage of delivered mRNA, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can synthesize mutant neo-antigens and multi-antigens and present epitopes to T lymphocytes to elicit antitumor effects. In addition, expressing receptors like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), T-cell receptor (TCR), CD134, and immune-modulating factors including cytokines, interferons, and antibodies in specific cells can enhance immunological response against tumors. With the maturation of in vitro transcription (IVT) technology, large-scale and pure mRNA encoding specific proteins can be synthesized quickly. However, the clinical translation of mRNA-based anticancer strategies is restricted by delivering mRNA into target organs or cells and the inadequate endosomal escape efficiency of mRNA. Recently, there have been some advances in mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy, which can be roughly classified as modifications of the mRNA structure and the development of delivery systems, especially the lipid nanoparticle platforms. In this review, the latest strategies for overcoming the limitations of mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies and the recent advances in delivering mRNA into specific organs and cells are summarized. Challenges and opportunities for clinical applications of mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy are also discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "The tumour-targeting efficiency of systemically delivered chemodrugs largely dictates the therapeutic outcome of anticancer treatment. Major challenges lie in the complexity of diverse biological barriers that drug delivery systems must hierarchically overcome to reach their cellular/subcellular targets. Herein, an \"all-in-one\" red blood cell (RBC)-derived microrobot that can hierarchically adapt to five critical stages during systemic drug delivery, that is, circulation, accumulation, release, extravasation, and penetration, is developed. The microrobots behave like natural RBCs in blood circulation, due to their almost identical surface properties, but can be magnetically manipulated to accumulate at regions of interest such as tumours. Next, the microrobots are \"immolated\" under laser irradiation to release their therapeutic cargoes and, by generating heat, to enhance drug extravasation through vascular barriers. As a coloaded agent, pirfenidone (PFD) can inhibit the formation of extracellular matrix and increase the penetration depth of chemodrugs in the solid tumour. It is demonstrated that this system effectively suppresses both primary and metastatic tumours in mouse models without evident side effects, and may represent a new class of intelligent biomimicking robots for biomedical applications.",

Data were obtained from a nationwide OHCA registry in Japan. Overall, 222,056 patients with OHCA and an initial non-shockable rhythm were identified from the registry in 2016 and 2017. Patients aged <18 years and OHCA caused by cardiogenic origin, cancer, and external factors were excluded. Finally, 58,854 participants were included. Patients were classified into the training dataset (n=29,304, data from 2016) and the test dataset (n=29,550, data from 2017). The training dataset was used to train and develop the machine learning model, and the test dataset was used for internal validation. We selected XGBoost as the machine learning classifier. The primary outcome was the poor prognosis defined as cerebral performance category of 3-5 at 1 month. Eleven prehospital variables were selected as outcome predictors. In validation, the machine learning model predicted the primary outcome with an accuracy of 90.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 90.5-91.2], a sensitivity of 91.4% [CI: 90.7-91.4], a specificity of 74.1% [CI: 69.2-78.6], and an area under the receiver operating characteristic value of 0.89 [0.87-0.92]. The important features for model development were the prehospital return of spontaneous circulation, prehospital adrenaline administration, and initial electrical rhythm. We developed a favorable machine learning model to predict the prognosis of non-cardiogenic OHCA with an initial non-shockable rhythm in the early stage of resuscitation.",

In recent years, total laparoscopic PPG (TLPPG), an anastomosis which is performed intracorporeally, has increasingly replaced laparoscopic-assisted PPG (LAPPG) due to its minimal invasiveness. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of TLPPG in terms of perioperative efficacy. Three patients underwent TLPPG in the Affiliated Hospital of Changzhi Medical College from September 2021 to March 2022. Surgical safety analysis: Our three cases (TLPPG group) were compared to data from the CLASS-02 study, which collected data from multiple centers across China for the laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG group). The CLASS-02 study provides data from the most invasive type of gastric surgery, providing solid comparative data to our own.Postoperative short-term efficacy analysis: Patient questionnaire responses provided data on postoperative nutritional and QOL status. Results from our three cases were compared to the Japanese multicenter data PGSAS-37 (PGSAS group). There were no complications or deaths occurred during or after operation in our cases. Compared to the PGSAS group, our cases scored lower for abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and weight loss. Although more case information is needed, our findings demonstrate that TLPPG may be a possible and effective treatment for EGC in China, similar to that in Japan.",

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally characterized by a high prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a spindle-shaped, Gram-negative anaerobe pathogen derived from the oral cavity. This tumor-resident microorganism has been closely correlated with the occurrence, progression, chemoresistance and immunosuppressive microenvironment of CRC. Furthermore, F. nucleatum can specifically colonize CRC tissues through adhesion on its surface, forming biofilms that are highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop efficacious non-antibiotic approaches to eradicate F. nucleatum and its biofilms for CRC treatment. In recent years, various antimicrobial strategies, such as natural extracts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, polymers, inorganic-organic hybrid materials, bacteriophages, probiotics, and vaccines, have been proposed to combat F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum biofilms. This review summarizes the latest advancements in anti-F. nucleatum research, elucidates the antimicrobial mechanisms employed by these systems, and discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each antimicrobial technology. Additionally, this review also provides an outlook on the antimicrobial specificity, potential clinical implications, challenges, and future improvements of these antimicrobial strategies in the treatment of CRC.",

In this review, the current nanoplatforms that regulate Ca2+ homeostasis for cancer therapy are first discussed, including both direct and indirect approaches to manage Ca2+ overload or inhibit Ca2+ signalling. Then, the applications of these nanoplatforms in targeting different cells to regulate their Ca2+ homeostasis for achieving therapeutic effects in cancer treatment are systematically introduced, including tumour cells and immune cells. Finally, perspectives on the further development of nanoplatforms for regulating Ca2+ homeostasis, identifying scientific limitations and future directions for exploitation are offered.",

Patients with severe mental illness are at higher risk of contracting the virus due to social determinants of health. Vulnerable populations include the elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, and those exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, only a few countries have updated vaccination strategies to prioritize patients with mental illnesses. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether individuals with mental disorders are prioritized in vaccine allocation strategies in different world regions. They are often neglected in policymaking but are highly vulnerable to the threatening complications of COVID-19. A questionnaire was developed to record details regarding COVID-19 vaccination and prioritizations for groups of persons with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs). NCDs were defined according to the WHO as chronic diseases that are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Most countries surveyed (80%) reported healthcare delivery via a nationalized health service. It was found that 82% of the countries had set up advisory groups, but only 26% included a mental health professional. Most frequently, malignancy (68%) was prioritized followed by diabetes type 2 (62%) and type 1 (59%). Only nine countries (26%) prioritized mental health conditions. The spread of the coronavirus has exposed both the strengths and flaws of our healthcare systems. The most vulnerable groups suffered the most and were hit first and faced most challenges. These findings raise awareness that patients with mental illnesses have been overlooked in immunization campaigns.

In this study, we examined factors related to deaths of despair (alcohol use, drug use, smoking) and contextual factors (perceived discrimination, socioeconomic status, neighborhood conditions) as predictors of premature deaths before the age of 65 years among African Americans. The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a longitudinal cohort study of African Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi, metropolitan statistical area. We included participants younger than 65 years at baseline (n=4000). Participant enrollment began in 2000 and data for these analyses were collected through 2019.

In this report, we review our experience with Sleeve Pneumonectomy (SP) and analyze both operative risks and outcomes. A retrospective review identified 34 patients who underwent SP: 19 underwent salvage SP and 15 underwent non-salvage SP. Salvage surgery was performed for recurrent lung cancer after chemoradiotherapy and could be considered if there were no other therapeutic options or in the presence of urgent symptoms, such as hemoptysis, obstructive pneumonia, superior vena cava syndrome, or tracheoesophageal fistula.The perioperative morbidity and oncological outcomes of salvage and non-salvage SP were analyzed. Most cases were of lung cancer, whereas salvage SP included one case of SVC syndrome due to metastasis of colon cancer and one case of hemoptysis due to metastasis of leiomyosarcoma. Complications occurred in 47% of the non-salvage SP cases and 53% of the salvage SP cases. The 30-day mortality rates were zero in the non-salvage cases and 11% in the salvage cases. The 90-day mortality rates were 20% and 16% in the non-salvage and salvage groups, respectively. The salvage of SP after chemoradiotherapy or in the presence of urgent symptoms is feasible. We believe that it can be an option that improves quality of life (QOL) through longer desease-free survival (DFS) and alleviation of symptoms, rather than waiting for tumor growth progression and exacerbation of symptoms.",

Previous studies have found that some perfluoroalkyl acids, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), induced colorectal tumors in experimental animals and promoted the migration of and invasion by CRC cells in vitro, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of PFOS on the proliferation and migration of CRC cells and the potential mechanisms involving activating the PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB signal pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It was found that PFOS promoted the growth and migration of HCT116 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations and increased the mRNA expression of the migration-related angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In a mechanistic investigation, the up-stream signal pathway PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB was activated by PFOS, and the process was suppressed by LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and BAY11-7082 (NF-\u03baB inhibitor) respectively, leading to less proliferation of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and EMT-related markers were up-regulated after PFOS exposure, and were also suppressed respectively by LY294002 and BAY11-7082. Moreover, the up-regulation of EMT markers was suppressed by a MMP inhibitor GM6001. Taken together, our results indicated that PFOS promotes colorectal cancer cell migration and proliferation by activating the PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB signal pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

In this retrospective cohort study, five North American endoscopists without prior training in magnifying endoscopy independently diagnosed images of gastrointestinal tract lesions using UMEC. All endoscopists were blinded to endoscopic findings and histopathological diagnosis. Using histopathology as the gold standard, the endoscopists' diagnostic performances using UMEC were evaluated. A total of 299 lesions (77 esophagus, 92 stomach, and 130 colon) were assessed. For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 65.2% (95%CI: 50.9-77.9) to 87.0% (95%CI: 75.3-94.6), 77.4% (95%CI: 60.9-89.6) to 96.8% (95%CI: 86.8-99.8), and 75.3% to 87.0%, respectively. For gastric adenocarcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 94.9% (95%CI: 85.0-99.1) to 100%, 52.9% (95%CI: 39.4-66.2) to 92.2% (95%CI: 82.7-97.5), and 73.3% to 93.3%. For colorectal adenocarcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 76.2% (95%CI: 62.0-87.3) to 83.3% (95%CI: 70.3-92.5), 89.7% (95%CI: 82.1-94.9) to 97.7% (95%CI: 93.1-99.6), and 86.8% to 90.7%. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated good to excellent reliability. UMEC is a simple classification that may be used to introduce endoscopists to magnifying narrow-band imaging and optical diagnosis, yielding satisfactory diagnostic accuracy.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between preoperative low skeletal muscle index (SMI) measured by L3 CT and postoperative clinical outcomes in PC resectable patients. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched for articles published through May 2023. Duplicate titles and abstracts, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed. A meta-analysis was performed for overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), morbidity, and postoperative length of stay (P-LOS). The risk of bias was assessed. A total of 2942 patients with PC from 11 studies were identified. Preoperative low SMI was found in 50.9% of PC resectable patients. Preoperative low SMI was significantly associated with adjusted OS (adjusted HR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.25-1.86, P< 0.0001). No significant associations were found between preoperative low SMI and RFS, number of POPF, significant morbidity, and P-LOS (P>0.05). SMI should be evaluated in a timely manner as a predictor of OS in PC resectable patients.

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) have been historically regarded as rare, but their incidence has raised more than 6-fold over the last 3 decades, mostly owing to improvement in the detection of small asymptomatic tumours with imaging. Early detection and proper classification and staging are essential for the prognosis and management of panNENs. Histological evaluation is mandatory in all patients for the diagnosis of panNEN. Regarding localization and staging, multiphasic contrast-enhanced computer tomography is considered the imaging study of choice. Nevertheless, several other diagnostic modalities might present complementary information that can help in diagnosis and staging optimization: magnetic resonance imaging, somatostatin receptor imaging using positron emission tomography in combination with computed tomography (PET/CT), PET/CT with fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and endoscopic ultrasound. Approximately 10% of panNENs are due to an inherited syndrome, which includes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), tuberous sclerosis complex, and Mahvash disease. In this review, the Portuguese Pancreatic Club summarizes the classification, diagnosis, and staging of panNENs, with a focus on imaging studies. It also summarizes the characteristics and particularities of panNENs associated with inherited syndromes.

        "AbstractText": "Liquid biopsies, in particular the profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), have long held promise as transformative tools in cancer precision medicine. Despite a prolonged incubation phase, ctDNA profiling has recently experienced a strong wave of development and innovation, indicating its imminent integration into the cancer management toolbox. Various advancements in mutation-based ctDNA analysis methodologies and technologies have greatly improved sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA assays, such as optimized preanalytics, size-based pre-enrichment strategies, targeted sequencing, enhanced library preparation methods, sequencing error suppression, integrated bioinformatics and machine learning. Moreover, research breakthroughs have expanded the scope of ctDNA analysis beyond hotspot mutational profiling of plasma-derived apoptotic, mono-nucleosomal ctDNA fragments. This broader perspective considers alternative genetic features of cancer, genome-wide characterization, classical and newly discovered epigenetic modifications, structural variations, diverse cellular and mechanistic ctDNA origins, and alternative biospecimen types. These developments have maximized the utility of ctDNA, facilitating landmark research, clinical trials, and the commercialization of ctDNA assays, technologies, and products. Consequently, ctDNA tests are increasingly recognized as an important part of patient guidance and are being implemented in clinical practice. Although reimbursement for ctDNA tests by healthcare providers still lags behind, it is gaining greater acceptance. In this work, we provide a comprehensive exploration of the extensive landscape of ctDNA profiling methodologies, considering the multitude of factors that influence its development and evolution. By illuminating the broader aspects of ctDNA profiling, the aim is to provide multiple entry points for understanding and navigating the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of ctDNA methodologies, applications, and technologies.",

        "AbstractText": "Physical activity (PA) is significantly associated with many health outcomes. The wide usage of wearable accelerometer-based activity trackers in recent years has provided a unique opportunity for in-depth research on PA and its relations with health outcomes and interventions. Past analysis of activity tracker data relies heavily on aggregating minute-level PA records into day-level summary statistics in which important information of PA temporal/diurnal patterns is lost. In this paper we propose a novel functional data analysis approach based on Riemann manifolds for modeling PA and its longitudinal changes. We model smoothed minute-level PA of a day as one-dimensional Riemann manifolds and longitudinal changes in PA in different visits as deformations between manifolds. The variability in changes of PA among a cohort of subjects is characterized via variability in the deformation. Functional principal component analysis is further adopted to model the deformations, and PC scores are used as a proxy in modeling the relation between changes in PA and health outcomes and/or interventions. We conduct comprehensive analyses on data from two clinical trials: Reach for Health (RfH) and Metabolism, Exercise and Nutrition at UCSD (MENU), focusing on the effect of interventions on longitudinal changes in PA patterns and how different modes of changes in PA influence weight loss, respectively. The proposed approach reveals unique modes of changes, including overall enhanced PA, boosted morning PA, and shifts of active hours specific to each study cohort. The results bring new insights into the study of longitudinal changes in PA and health and have the potential to facilitate designing of effective health interventions and guidelines.",

We evaluated a new endoscopic hydrogel for submucosal injection and its clinical feasibility. Patients and methods A hydrogel (AceGel) containing 0.4% sodium alginate and 2% calcium lactate was developed for ex vivo and animal studies. Subsequently, a prospective, single-arm study was conducted to assess its feasibility and safety in humans. Patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms undergoing endoscopic resection were enrolled. All patients underwent endoscopic surveillance after 4 weeks and outpatient follow-up at week 6. Afterward, they received endoscopic follow-up according to the medical routine. Results In the ex vivo experiments, the submucosal elevation height of AceGel was equivalent to sodium hyaluronate and superior to saline or glycerol. Animal studies showed that the excised wounds healed well without surrounding tissue damage. Twelve patients participated in the clinical trial, including three, two, and seven patients with esophageal, gastric, and colonic lesions, respectively. The mean neoplasm size and submucosal injection volumes were 24.0\u00b18.6 mm and 22.8\u00b119.9 mL, respectively. All patients had adequate wound healing on 4-week surveillance endoscopy, and none had serious adverse events during 6-week follow-up. Moreover, endoscopic follow-up showed complete wound healing after 6 to 46 months without local mucosal inflammation in all patients. Conclusions AceGel is good for endoscopic submucosal injection and demonstrated its usefulness in durable mucosal elevation for endoscopic therapy in preclinical tests.

Research has indicated suboptimal CRC knowledge in Korean Americans as one of the main barriers to their recommended CRC screening. Also, research has shown the potential of online health information seeking (OHIS) to improving cancer knowledge and the gender-based differences in the link between OHIS and cancer knowledge. Thus, this study aimed to examine the association between OHIS and CRC knowledge and the moderating effect of gender in this association among Korean Americans. A cross-sectional survey with purposive sampling was conducted of 421 Korean Americans aged 50 to 75 years in the Southeastern U.S. Three-step hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate if three blocks of variables-Block 1: control variables (sociodemographics and health-related information), Block 2: independent variables (OHIS and gender), and Block 3: an (OHIS \u00d7 gender) interaction term-significantly reduce unexplained variance in CRC knowledge. The analyses showed that the final model fits best accounting for 29.3% of the variance in CRC knowledge. Also, the analyses showed that OHIS was positively associated with CRC knowledge and gender moderated the association between OHIS and CRC knowledge. The findings close the knowledge gap existing in the body of literature on the connection of OHIS to CRC knowledge in Korean Americans. Findings also extend the understanding of gender-specific approaches leveraging OHIS for CRC prevention education among Korean Americans.",

This study aimed to investigate independent risk factors for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic schizophrenia. In addition, the possible causal inter-relationships among these independent risk factors and all-cause mortality were also explored. We conducted an analysis of 1,126 patients with chronic schizophrenia from our psychiatric department from April 2003 to August 2022, and retrospectively reviewed their medical records. The study endpoint was all-cause mortality. Baseline clinical characteristics including sociodemographic data, biochemical data, lifestyle factors, comorbidities and antipsychotic treatment were examined with Cox proportional hazards analysis. The all-cause mortality rate was 3.9% (44 patients). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that several factors were independently associated with all-cause mortality, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, ileus, underweight, fasting glucose, triglycerides, albumin, and hemoglobin. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that several factors had statistically significant direct effects on all-cause mortality. Heart failure, hypertension, underweight, age at onset, and ileus showed positive direct effects, while albumin and hemoglobin demonstrated negative direct effects. In addition, several factors had indirect effects on all-cause mortality. GERD indirectly affected all-cause mortality through ileus, and peptic ulcer disease had indirect effects through albumin and ileus. Ileus, underweight, DM, and hypertension also exhibited indirect effects through various pathways involving albumin, hemoglobin, and heart failure. Overall, the final model, which included these factors, explained 13% of the variability in all-cause mortality. These results collectively suggest that the presence of DM, hypertension, heart failure, GERD, peptic ulcer disease, ileus, and underweight, along with lower levels of albumin or hemoglobin, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. The SEM analysis further revealed potential causal pathways and inter-relationships among these risk factors contributing to all-cause mortality in patients with chronic schizophrenia.",

As these interactions affect nanoparticle delivery, we studied the preclinical literature from 2011-2021 and analyzed nanoparticle blood circulation and organ biodistribution data. Our findings revealed that nanoparticle surface chemistry affected the in vivo behavior more than other nanoparticle design parameters. Combinatory biological-PEG surface modification improved the blood area under the curve by ~418%, with a decrease in liver accumulation of up to 47%.

Approximately 62% of total patients had stage 4 disease, and 30% of all patients had brain metastasis. There were 54% of patients who were treated with chemotherapy and 15% with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In patients with brain metastasis, 16% were treated with ICI, 18% with targeted therapy, and 59% with chemotherapy. The median survival of the entire group was 23.8 months. Among patients with stage 4 disease (n\u00a0= 222): 51% were women, 64% were white, 37% had brain metastasis, 18% were treated with ICI, 14% had targeted therapy, and 60% were treated with chemotherapy. Stage 4 patients treated with targeted therapy had better survival compared with those who did not receive targeted therapy (20.6 versus 16.1 mo, p\u00a0= 0.02). Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested favorable outcomes for patients treated with immunotherapy. EGFR ex20ins mutation represents a unique subset of NSCLC; it is associated with a higher propensity for brain metastases and a relatively modest overall survival. Novel treatment approaches are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes.",

The purpose of the study was to explore whether the distributions of BC types differed by obesity status. We conducted a study to evaluate BC type in US population during 2012-2016. A total of 191 White participants from Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT) completed a self-administered Traditional Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (TCMQ, English version). In this study, we further compared the distribution of major types of TCM BC in the PPCCT to those Chinese populations stratified by obesity status. We found the Blood-stasis frequency was higher in US White adults, 22.6% for individuals with BMI <30 and 11.2% for obese individuals, compared to 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, in Chinese populations. We also found the percentages Inherited-special and Qi-stagnation were higher in US White adults than those in Chinese populations regardless of obesity status. However, the proportions of Yang-deficiency were higher in Chinese populations than those in our study conducted in US White adults regardless of obesity status. These new findings indicate the difference in distribution of BC types we observed between US and Chinese populations cannot be explained by the differences in prevalence of obesity. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and understand the potential mechanism including genetic background and/or environmental factors.",

Despite advancements in surgery and chemoradiation therapies, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 11% in the United States. Cryoablation is emerging as a new and effective therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and symptom palliation in metastatic disease. To our knowledge, the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after cryoablation is rare. A 47-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure followed by chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Due to the abdominal lymph nodes, peritoneum, right femur, and surrounding soft tissue metastases, she received systemic palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel and underwent right femur tumor excision, open reduction, and internal fixation, followed by radiation therapy. She continued to have persistent pain and underwent palliative percutaneous cryoablation of the metastatic tumor under computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound guidance. Immediately post procedure, she developed slow but continuous blood oozing at the ablation site, which was difficult to control despite compression dressings, reinforcement sutures, and local thrombin powder. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with petechiae in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies were consistent with DIC and peripheral blood smear revealed multiple schistocytes. CT angiogram of the right lower extremity did not show any bleeding vessel amenable to embolization. She was transfused red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Despite multiple daily transfusions, she continued to have pain and remained persistently thrombocytopenic and coagulopathic. After discussion with the patient and her family, she chose to transition to comfort care measures and died. DIC is an unusual but life-threatening complication of advanced pancreatic cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "A longitudinal observational study was conducted and aimed to examine the change in resilience among spousal caregivers of newly-diagnosed advanced cancer patients over the first six months after initial treatment. In total, 312 Chinese spousal caregivers who were taking care of their patients with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer were recruited. The level of resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale at the first month post-initial treatment (T1), three-month post-initial treatment (T2), and six-month post-initial treatment (T3). Latent growth modeling analyses were performed to examine changes in resilience using Mplus 8.3. The mean scores of resilience in spousal caregivers were 54.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.68 at T1, 56.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.38 at T2, and 57.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.70 at T3, respectively. Results of latent growth modeling indicated that spousal caregivers showed a significant increase in their resilience scores over the first six months post-treatment (Mean slope\u00a0=\u00a01.98, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, a significant individual variation in the rate of changes in resilience scores allowed spouses to be categorized into two groups: 42.9% participants with fast growth and 57.1% participants with slight growth. Our findings highlight the importance that new knowledge about change patterns of resilience in the nursing field is beneficial to reveal different psychosomatic health. Acknowledging that resilience is a dynamic process that changes over time, it is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor the psychological adjustment and focus of vulnerable caregivers, particularly spouses.",

Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO # CRD42021218748) is aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PDT-induced oxidative stress in OPMDs METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched without restriction of language or year of publication. In addition, gray literature was searched and a manual search was performed. Two independent reviewers screened all the studies, assessing data extraction, risk of bias and certainty of evidence. A narrative synthesis was carried out. For the meta-analysis, random effects were considered to determine the prevalence of a total and a partial remission (PR) of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). The certainty of evidence was explored using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-three studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses. A total of 880 patients were included (564 males; 218 females) with an age range between 24 and 89-years-old. The results showed the prevalence of the total and partial remissions respectively for the following OPMLs: actinic cheilitis (AC): 69.9% and 2.4%; oral leukoplakia (OL): 44% and 36.9%; oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH): 98.5%; oral erythroleukoplakia (OEL): 92.1% and 7.9%. The prevalence of no remission of OL was 18.8%. PDT demonstrated significant results in clinical remission of OPMDs and most of the eligible studies have shown a total or a partial remission of the included lesions, but at a low or a very low certainty of evidence. Hence, further clinical studies with robust methodology are warranted to offer further validated data. Also, further evidence is required to understand further the mechanism of PDT-induced oxidative stress.",

Even with maximal treatment, patients show a low median survival and are often subjected to a high recurrence incidence. The currently available treatments require multimodal management, including maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Because of the infiltrative glioblastoma nature, intraoperative differentiation of cancer tissue from normal brain parenchyma is very challenging, and this accounts for the low rate of complete tumor resection. For these reasons, clinicians have increasingly used various intraoperative adjuncts to improve surgical results, such as fluorescent agents. However, most of the existing fluorophores show several limitations such as poor selectivity, photostability, photosensitization and high costs. This could limit their application to successfully improve glioblastoma resection. In the present perspective, we highlight the possibility to develop next-generation fluorescent tools able to more selectively label cancer cells during surgical resection.",

        "AbstractText": "Prussian blue nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy (PBNP-PTT) is an effective tumor treatment capable of eliciting an antitumor immune response. Motivated by the ability of PBNP-PTT to potentiate endogenous immune responses, we recently demonstrated that PBNP-PTT could be used ex vivo to generate tumor-specific T cells against glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines as an adoptive T cell therapy (ATCT). In this study, we further developed this promising T cell development platform. First, we assessed the phenotype and function of T cells generated using PBNP-PTT. We observed that PBNP-PTT facilitated CD8+ T cell expansion from healthy donor PBMCs that secreted IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 and upregulated CD107a in response to engagement with target U87 cells, suggesting specific antitumor T cell activation and degranulation. Further, CD8+ effector and effector memory T cell populations significantly expanded after co-culture with U87 cells, consistent with tumor-specific effector responses. In orthotopically implanted U87 GBM tumors in vivo, PBNP-PTT-derived T cells effectively reduced U87 tumor growth and generated long-term survival in >80% of tumor-bearing mice by Day 100, compared to 0% of mice treated with PBS, non-specific T cells, or T cells expanded from lysed U87 cells, demonstrating an enhanced antitumor efficacy of this ATCT platform. Finally, we tested the generalizability of our approach by generating T cells targeting medulloblastoma (D556), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines. The resulting T cells secreted IFN\u03b3 and exerted increased tumor-specific cytolytic function relative to controls, demonstrating the versatility of PBNP-PTT in generating tumor-specific T cells for ATCT.",

The proper selection of fixed and random effects is a critical part of the modeling process, where model misspecification may lead to significant bias. However, the joint selection of fixed and random effects has historically been limited to lower dimensional GLMMs, largely due to the use of criterion-based model selection strategies. Here we present the R package glmmPen, one of the first to select fixed and random effects in higher dimension using a penalized GLMM modeling framework. Model parameters are estimated using a Monte Carlo expectation conditional minimization (MCECM) algorithm, which leverages Stan and RcppArmadillo for increased computational efficiency. Our package supports the Binomial, Gaussian, and Poisson families and multiple penalty functions. In this manuscript we discuss the modeling procedure, estimation scheme, and software implementation through application to a pancreatic cancer subtyping study.

The present study is a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. All patients who underwent HAIC for colorectal liver metastases between July 2022 and July 2023 were included. A total of 12 patients were included in the study of which 11 completed four sessions as planned. The median age was 47 (29-73) years with nine male (81%) and two female (18%) patients. Rectum (n = 7, 63%) was the most common primary location. All patients received systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil-based regimens prior to HAIC (median 12 cycles). The median number of metastasis was 2 (1-8). Eight patients had metastasis in unilobar distribution (73%). On completion of HAIC treatment, nine patients (64%) were completely disease free with a median follow-up of 8 months. None of the patients experienced any immediate adverse events during or after completion of the procedure. Conventional HAIC comes with various challenges such as unavailability of the agent floxuridine and the specialized HAIC pump. Percutaneous HAIC has a lower chance of infection.

RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemical, cell proliferation, assay of wound healing, transwell migration assay, invasion assay, flow cytometry, and immune evaluation experiments were carried out. SMPDL3B was found to be substantially expressed in GAC, and this condition has a bad prognosis. By establishing SMPDL3B knockdown and overexpression of GAC cell lines, this study confirmed that SMPDL3B promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additional bioinformatics research revealed a connection between SMPDL3B and immune cell infiltration in the GAC immunological microenvironment, which enhanced tumor cell proliferation by promoting the infiltration content of M2 macrophages. This study determined the function of SMPDL3B for the clinical diagnosis, prediction, and novel management of GAC.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a difficult clinical entity to manage. The aim of the study was to investigate the sociodemographic and pathological characteristics, treatment options, and factors affecting overall survival (OS) in CUP patients whose primary tumor was not detected during follow-up. A total of 243 CUP patients whose primary tumors could not be detected during follow-up were included in the study. Their demographic characteristics, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were investigated. Of the 243 patients included in this study, 61.7% were male and 38.3% were female, and the median age was 61 (range: 19-90) years. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (79%). The median follow-up time of the patients was 30.3 months (95% CI: 11.4-49.3), the median OS time was 9.1 months (95% CI: 7.2-11.0), and 72.4% of the patients received at least 1 line of chemotherapy (CT). The difference in survival between the patients who did and did not receive CT was statistically significant (median OS: 10.1 vs. 4.2 months, p = 0.003). According to the multivariate analysis, the presence of cholestasis (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.79, p = 0.004), lung metastasis (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.95, p = 0.001), second-line chemotherapy (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.14-2.49, p < 0.001), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10-0.40, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors influencing OS. CUP patients who receive multiple lines of chemotherapy tend to have longer survival. This is the first study to report cholestasis as a prognostic factor in CUP patients. In addition, the presence of lung metastases, not receiving second-line chemotherapy, and ECOG performance status (\u22652) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors.",

Because these noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, they have properties similar to messenger RNA (mRNA). Contrary to popular belief, the term \"ncRNA\" originated before the discovery of microRNAs. LncRNA genes are more numerous than protein-coding genes. They are the focus of current molecular research because of their pivotal roles in cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing around the world and research on the molecular aspects of PC are growing. In this review, it is aimed to provide critical information about lncRNAs in PC, including the biological and oncological behaviors of lncRNAs in PC and their potential application in therapeutic strategies and as diagnostic tumor markers.",

        "AbstractText": "Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) is involved in the cysteine-rich protein family and is a marker of smooth muscle lineages. In colon cancer, the expression of this gene is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, the aim was to reevaluate its prognostic relationship in independent cohorts and explore potential underlying biological processes that are linked to aggressive behavior in tumors with high CSRP1 expression, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stromal fractions in the tumor microenvironment, and consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-, microarray-, and single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based transcriptomic data were obtained from public databases. The EMT score was calculated based on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin genes using a previously published method. The stromal score generated by the ESTIMATE method was utilized for the analysis of correlation with the CSRP1 expression. The scRNAseq data were analyzed via the Seurat R package. The immunohistochemistry-based protein level expression of CSRP1 was evaluated using the Human Protein Atlas database. Lower CSRP1 expression was noted in colon tumors compared to normal colon tissue. Patients with a high CSRP1 expression had shorter recurrence-free, overall, and disease-specific survivals in the GSE39582 and GSE17536 datasets (p < 0.05). The methylation level of the CSRP1 gene was negatively correlated (r = -0.57, p < 0.0001) with CSRP1 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas colon adenocarcinoma dataset. CSRP1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of mesenchymal markers, EMT score, and stromal score obtained via the ESTIMATE method. CMS4 colon tumors had a significantly higher CSRP1 expression compared to other CMSs. Analysis of the scRNAseq data revealed that CSRP1 was expressed by epithelial cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the colorectal tumor microenvironment, which was also confirmed by the protein expression data from the Human Protein Atlas database. CSRP1 expression is associated with CMS4, a more mesenchymal stroma-rich molecular profile, and poor prognosis in colon cancer.",

The metastasis of the HCC cells was measured with wound healing and transwell assays. The protein expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assayed with western blotting. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA-pulldown assays were used to determine the link between miR-622 and circ-0006091 or CCNB1.

The Cornus mas L. and Berberis vulgaris fruits, which constitute the herbal material of the study, were turned into 80% acetone extract after washing. The total phenolic content in Berberis vulgaris fruit extracts was determined calorimetrically using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The spectrophotometric method was used to determine the total flavonoid amount of the extracts. In order to measure the antioxidant capacity of Cornus mas L. and Berberis vulgaris fruits and extracts, DPPH Radical Scavenging Power test and Cu (II) ion reducing antioxidant capacity method were applied. Cell viability rates were determined by the XTT method. Flow cytometric measurement was performed to examine the apoptotic role of the extracts in the cell by using the Annexin-V/7-AAD commercial kit. According to the data, Berberis vulgaris fruit extract appeared more effective on MCF-7 breast cancer cells in both 24 and 48 hours of exposure. Analyses made to examine the phenolic component and antioxidant capacity properties of the fruits used in the study and the results we encountered when we exposed the cell were found to be compatible with each other. Annexin-V/7-AAD method showed that the apoptotic effects of the extracts in 48 hour exposures were more effective.

        "ArticleTitle": "Investigating the physiological role of S199A and S199D mutants of PHF6 protein in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
        "AbstractText": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a form of leukemia characterized by the proliferation of immature T lymphocytes. NOTCH1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in T-ALL. NOTCH1 expression in T-cell development depends on plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6), which plays a tumor suppressor role in T-ALL. Several studies have shown that PHF6 expression is essential for NOTCH1 expression. Therefore, whether posttranslational modification of PHF6 plays a role in the regulation of NOTCH1 expression and T-ALL cell line proliferation was investigated herein. The amino acid sequence of PHF6 was analyzed and it was found that a putative protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation motif RDRS199 was conserved in several vertebrate species and the S199 site was expected to be phosphorylated according to the PhosphoSite database. Therefore, an eukaryotic expression vector of human PHF6 was constructed, and the codon 199 was changed to the codon encoding the nonphosphorylatable alanine and the phosphorylation-mimicking aspartic acid via site-directed mutagenesis. After confirming the ectopic expressions of the PHF6 vectors by western blot analysis, the effects of these proteins were identified on the NOTCH1 expression using western blot analysis, leukemic cell proliferation using MTT assay, and expressions of the cell surface markers of T-cells using flow cytometry. The ectopic expression of wild-type PHF6 stimulated the formation of CD4 + T-cells. While the expression of the wild-type PHF6 suppressed the growth of the leukemic cell line, this effect was diminished in both the alanine and aspartic acid mutants of PHF6. In addition, both mutants also seemed to negatively affect the NOTCH1 expression, although the effect of the alanine mutant was more severe. Taken together, the different biological activities exerted by the conserved S199 phosphorylation-site mutants shown in this study implicate that signaling pathway(s) leading to differential phosphorylation of this residue may have a substantial effect on the activity of PHF6, and thus may constitute a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.",

Methods: We searched our prospectively collected endocrine surgery thyroid nodule (TN) database, with particular attention to those solid nodules that were NC ATA. An algorithm assigned each into one of the five ATA risk groups per the 2015 American Thyroid Association Ultrasound Risk Stratification System (ATA USRSS). TNs that the algorithm could not assign to a risk group were deemed NC ATA and were subsequently analyzed. Additionally, we categorized this group using an algorithm based on the 2017 American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS). We were specifically interested in the characteristics that resulted in non-classification by the 2015 ATA USRSS and the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology and surgical pathology results from the group. Results: We evaluated data from 5,040 nodules, of which 1,772 had surgical pathology. There were 150 solid nodules not classified by 2015 ATA USRSS, all of which demonstrated atypical features along with iso-, hetero-, hyper-and mixed echogenicity (solid atypical mixed echogenicity nodules-SAMENs). Sixty of these nodules were excised and sent for surgical pathology, while 90 were followed without surgical excision. Out of the 90 that did not undergo surgery, 82 underwent FNAB with cytologic evaluation. Of our 150 SAMENs, 40 were malignant by surgical histology and six were likely malignant by cytology (total SAMEN ROM without noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-l ike nuclear features 31%). The most common sonographic pattern present in our SAMEN group consisted of an isoechoic solid component with microcalcifications (28/40-70% of all excised malignant nodules). In our excised malignant SAMENs, 50% demonstrated follicular-patterned neoplastic architecture while 48% displayed papillary architecture. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that SAMENs with at least one suspicious sonographic feature: including (1) microcalcifications; (2) irregular or other suspicious margins,;opulation, and a higher ROM (31%) than the intermediate-risk group of the 2015 ATA USRSS (10-20%).",

Tumor delineation with intraoperative use of sodium fluorescein (NaFl) facilitates total resection. When used with AC, it may allow for safe resection without increasing the risk of postoperative neurologic deficits. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the combined use of NaFl and AC for maximum safe resection in patients with brain metastases. Patients who underwent AC due to brain metastasis in the Department of Neurosurgery of Uluda\u011f University's Faculty of Medicine between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The study comprised 2 patient groups: plain AC (pAC) and NaFl-guided AC (NaFlg-AC). Surgical outcomes related to fluorescence intensity, degree of resection, perioperative complications, and postoperative neurological factors were evaluated. The pAC group included 16 patients (12 males, 4 females), and the NaFlg-AC group comprised 21 (13 males, 7 females). The mean patient ages for males and females were 61.4 years (61.4 \u00b1 9.5 years) and 60.4 years (60.6 \u00b1 12 years), respectively. The most common origin of the metastatic lesion was the lung in both the pAC and NaFlg-AC groups (n = 12 vs. n = 14, respectively). Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 85.7% of the patients in the NaFlg-AC group, whereas the GTR rate was 68.7% in the pAC group. There was no significant difference in GTR rates between the 2 groups (p = 0.254). The mean duration of the resection time was significantly shorter in the NaFlg-AC group (45.95 \u00b1 7.00 min vs. 57.5 \u00b1 12.51 min; p = 0.002). The patients' Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score did not reach statistical significance at 6-month follow-up in either group compared to their preoperative baseline scores (p = 0.374). KPS did not show a significant difference between the 2 groups at any time. Fluorescence-guided resection in AC for metastatic tumors in sensory, motor, and cognitive areas is a feasible, safe, and convenient technique that significantly increases GTR rates and shortens operative time compared to conventional white light surgery without fluorescence guidance. It also does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. With the combined use of AC and NaFl, ensuring clear and visible tumor margins during surgery and controlling patients' neurological function in real-time are possible.",

Two radiologists independently evaluated the MR and CEM images in separate sessions, using the BI-RADS classification system. Additionally, the maximum sizes of lesion were measured. Diagnostic accuracy parameters and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for the two modalities. The correlation between the maximum diameter of breast lesions observed in MRI, CEM, and pathology was analyzed. The overall diagnostic values for MRI were as follows: sensitivity 97.1%, specificity 60%, positive predictive value (PPV) 77.3%, negative predictive value (NPV) 93.8%, and accuracy 81.7%. Correspondingly, for CEM, the sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.14%, 81.67%, 60%, 77.27%, and 93.75%, respectively.

Responders filled out hypothetical scenarios from 2 perspectives, either as treating physicians, or as patients themselves. A total of 212 (40.01%) responses were obtained. Median responder age was 39 years. 75% of responders were interested in \"urolithiasis\". 82.5% had never experienced a renal colic, 89.6% had never undergone urolithiasis treatment.Overall, as the kidney stone scenarios got more complicated, the invasiveness of the treatment preference increased. As \"the physician\", responders preferred the conservative option in all situations more than they would choose as \"the patient\". For ureteral stones, conservative approach was most preferred for small stones and ureteroscopy became more preferred as the stone size increased.For smaller kidney stones, the most preferred follow-up schedule was 4-6 monthly, whereas for larger and complicated stones it was 0-3 monthly from both perspectives respectively. For all ureteral stone scenarios, 0-4 weekly follow-up was mostly preferred.Interestingly, having had a renal colic was an independent predictor of an interventional approach, whereas having had an intervention was an independent predictor of a conservative approach. Current treatment and follow-up patterns of asymptomatic urinary stones are in agreement with international guidelines on symptomatic stones.In most of the urolithiasis situations urologists chose a conservative approach for their patients compared to what they would prefer for themselves.

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a disease with a high prevalence and incidence worldwide. Screening has pursued the early diagnosis of this disease to provide early treatment. We sought to characterize patients from a local hospital with respect to diagnosis and staging and to compare these results with previously reported data. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with PCa at an institutional hospital. Clinical variables were collected at the time of diagnosis, staging methods, TNM stage, and histological grade. 129 patients were included in the analysis. The median PSA (ng/mL) at diagnosis was 7.29. The histological grade was classified as ISUP 1 in 37.5%. An MRI was performed in 42.19% of the patients, being classified mostly as PIRADS 4 (21.09%). PET-CT PSMA staging was used mainly in the high-risk group, preferring contrast-enhanced CT and bone scintigraphy in the other groups. 6.25% were classified as N1 and 9.37% as M1. The stage at diagnosis in our series is somewhat higher than that reported by developed countries but considerably lower than that published by other Latin American countries and even from other hospitals in our country. It is of great national relevance to have clear protocols for screening and access to PSA to reduce the cases diagnosed in advanced stages.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A pH/ROS dual-responsive system for effective chemoimmunotherapy against melanoma via remodeling tumor immune microenvironment.",
        "AbstractText": "Chemotherapeutics can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumor cells, offering new possibilities for cancer therapy. However, the efficiency of the immune response generated is insufficient due to the inhibitory nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we developed a pH/reactive oxygen species (ROS) dual-response system to enhance chemoimmunotherapy for melanoma. The system productively accumulated in tumors by specific binding of phenylboronic acid (PBA) to sialic acids (SA). The nanoparticles (NPs) rapidly swelled and released quercetin (QUE) and doxorubicin (DOX) upon the stimulation of tumor microenvironment (TME). The in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo results consistently demonstrated that the NPs improved anti-tumor efficacy and prolonged survival of mice, significantly enhancing the effects of the combination. Our study revealed DOX was an ICD inducer, stimulating immune responses and promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, QUE served as a TME regulator by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) axis, which influenced various immune cells, including increasing cytotoxic T cells (CLTs) infiltration, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, and reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltration. The combination synergistically facilitated chemoimmunotherapy efficacy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work presents a promising strategy to increase anti-tumor efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The inhibitory effect of adenosine on tumor adaptive immunity and intervention strategies.",
        "AbstractText": "Adenosine (Ado) is significantly elevated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared to normal tissues. It binds to adenosine receptors (AdoRs), suppressing tumor antigen presentation and immune cell activation, thereby inhibiting tumor adaptive immunity. Ado downregulates major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and co-stimulatory factors on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, inhibiting antigen presentation. It suppresses anti-tumor cytokine secretion and T cell activation by disrupting T cell receptor (TCR) binding and signal transduction. Ado also inhibits chemokine secretion and KCa3.1 channel activity, impeding effector T cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor site. Furthermore, Ado diminishes T cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells by promoting immune-suppressive cytokine secretion, upregulating immune checkpoint proteins, and enhancing immune-suppressive cell activity. Reducing Ado production in the TME can significantly enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve the efficacy of other immunotherapies. Preclinical and clinical development of inhibitors targeting Ado generation or AdoRs is underway. Therefore, this article will summarize and analyze the inhibitory effects and molecular mechanisms of Ado on tumor adaptive immunity, as well as provide an overview of the latest advancements in targeting Ado pathways in anti-tumor immune responses.",

        "ArticleTitle": "In situ autophagy regulation in synergy with phototherapy for breast cancer treatment.",
        "AbstractText": "Autophagy is an important factor in reducing the efficacy of tumor phototherapy (including PTT and PDT). Accurate regulation of autophagy in tumor cells is a new strategy to improve the anti-tumor efficiency of PTT/PDT. This project intended to construct a tumor-activated autophagy regulator to efficiently block PTT/PDT-induced autophagy and realize synergistic sensitization to tumor phototherapy. To achieve this goal, we first synthesized TRANSFERRIN (Tf) biomimetic mineralized nano-tellurium (Tf-Te) as photosensitizer and then used disulfide bond reconstruction technology to induce Tf-Te self-assembly. The autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and iron ions carried by Tf were simultaneously loaded to prepare a tumor-responsive drug reservoir Tf-Te/HCQ. After entering breast cancer cells through the \"self-guidance system\", Tf-Te/HCQ can generate hyperpyrexia and ROS under NIR laser irradiation, to efficiently induce PTT/PDT effect. Meanwhile, the disulfide bond broke down in response to GSH, and the nanoparticles disintegrated to release Fe2+ and HCQ at fixed points. They simultaneously induce lysosomal alkalinization and increased osmotic pressure, effectively inhibit autophagy, and synergistically enhance the therapeutic effect of phototherapy. In\u00a0vivo anti-tumor results have proved that the tumor inhibition rate of Tf-Te/HCQ can be as high as 88.6% on 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This multifunctional drug delivery system might provide a new alternative for more precise and effective tumor phototherapy.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Feasibility and guidelines for the use of an injectable fiducial marker (BioXmark \u00ae) to improve target delineation in preclinical radiotherapy studies using mouse models.",
        "AbstractText": "Preclinical models of radiotherapy (RT) response are vital for the continued success and evolution of RT in the treatment of cancer. The irradiation of tissues in mouse models necessitates high levels of precision and accuracy to recapitulate clinical exposures and limit adverse effects on animal welfare. This requirement has been met by technological advances in preclinical RT platforms established over the past decade. Small animal RT systems use onboard computed tomography (CT) imaging to delineate target volumes and have significantly refined radiobiology experiments with major 3Rs impacts. However, the CT imaging is limited by the differential attenuation of tissues resulting in poor contrast in soft tissues. Clinically, radio-opaque fiducial markers (FMs) are used to establish anatomical reference points during treatment planning to ensure accuracy beam targeting, this approach is yet to translate back preclinical models. We report on the use of a novel liquid FM BioXmark \u00ae developed by Nanovi A/S (Kongens Lyngby, Denmark) that can be used to improve the visualisation of soft tissue targets during beam targeting and minimise dose to surrounding organs at risk. We present descriptive protocols and methods for the use of BioXmark \u00ae in experimental male and female C57BL/6J mouse models. These guidelines outline the optimum needle size for uptake (18-gauge) and injection (25- or 26-gauge) of BioXmark \u00ae for use in mouse models along with recommended injection volumes (10-20 \u00b5l) for visualisation on preclinical cone beam CT (CBCT) scans. Injection techniques include subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intra-tumoral and prostate injections. The use of BioXmark \u00ae can help to standardise targeting methods, improve alignment in preclinical image-guided RT and significantly improve the welfare of experimental animals with the reduction of normal tissue exposure to RT.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Measurement of very low-molecular weight metabolites by traveling wave ion mobility and its use in human urine samples.",
        "AbstractText": "The collision cross-sections (CCS) measurement using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) offers a great opportunity to increase confidence in metabolite identification. However, owing to the lack of sensitivity and resolution, IMS has an analytical challenge in studying the CCS values of very low-molecular-weight metabolites (VLMs \u2264 250\u00a0Da). Here, we describe an analytical method using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a traveling wave ion mobility-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer optimized for the measurement of VLMs in human urine samples. The experimental CCS values, along with mass spectral properties, were reported for the 174 metabolites. The experimental data included the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), retention time (RT), tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra, and CCS values. Among the studied metabolites, 263 traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS)-derived CCS values (TWCCSN2) were reported for the first time, and more than 70% of these were CCS values of VLMs. The TWCCSN2 values were highly repeatable, with inter-day variations of <1% relative standard deviation (RSD). The developed method revealed excellent TWCCSN2 accuracy with a CCS difference (\u0394CCS) within \u00b12% of the reported drift tube IMS (DTIMS) and TWIMS CCS values. The complexity of the urine matrix did not affect the precision of the method, as evidenced by \u0394CCS within \u00b11.92%. According to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, 55 urinary metabolites were identified with a confidence level of 1. Among these 55 metabolites, 53 (96%) were VLMs. The larger number of confirmed compounds found in this study was a result of the addition of TWCCSN2 values, which clearly increased metabolite identification confidence.",

        "AbstractText": "Obesity and related metabolic syndromes have been recognized as important disease risks, in which the role of adipokines cannot be ignored. Adiponectin (ADP) is one of the key adipokines with various beneficial effects, including improving glucose and lipid metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, promoting ceramides degradation, and stimulating adipose tissue vascularity. Based on those, it can serve as a positive regulator in many metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), sarcopenia, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain cancers. Therefore, a promising therapeutic approach for treating various metabolic diseases may involve elevating ADP levels or activating ADP receptors. The modulation of ADP genes, multimerization, and secretion covers the main processes of ADP generation, providing a comprehensive orientation for the development of more appropriate therapeutic strategies. In order to have a deeper understanding of ADP, this paper will provide an all-encompassing review of ADP.",

        "AbstractText": "DICER1 syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with the progressive development of malignant and non-malignant diseases in childhood. The cause of this syndrome is a dusfunction of the endoribonuclease DICER, which plays an important role in the processing of microRNAs with subsequent regulation of the control of the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Clinical manifestations of dyseropathies is very different and may include both endocrine manifestations - multinodular goiter, differentiated thyroid cancers, ovarian stromal tumors, pituitary blastoma, and non-endocrine formations - pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, pineoblastoma. The presence of somatic mutations of the DICER1 gene is a resultant stage in the pathogenesis of dyseropathies, determining the further path of oncogenesis. At present, DICER1 syndrome is diagnosed extremely rarely, which leads to late detection of the components of the disease in the patient, late diagnosis of neoplasms, lack of family counseling. Diagnosis at the early stages of the disease, the development of screening programs for the management of these patients allows minimizing the risks of developing more malignant, aggressive forms of

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) is a serious disease and is considered an important health problem worldwide. The prevalence of the disease in women according to Rosstat was 64,951 cases in the Russian Federation in 2020 (21.7% among all types of cancer). \u00a0Hormone-dependent estrogen receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) accounts for 70% of all cases. \u00a0About 40% of patients with ER+/HER2- mBC have mutations in the PIK3CA gene, leading to hyperactivation of the alpha isoform (p110\u03b1) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hormonal therapy with or without cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is considered the standard treatment for patients with ER+/HER2- mBC. However, acquired resistance to this therapy remains a problem. Innovative methods for the treatment of breast cancer are the use of targeted therapeutic agents aimed at direct inhibition of the PI3K pathway in combination with hormone therapy. Alpelisib is a PI3K\u03b1-specific inhibitor. Hyperglycemia is the most common side effect of alpelisib treatment. Currently, there is a consensus on the prevention and correction of hyperglycemia in patients receiving therapy with alpelisib, which recommends that before starting therapy, in \u00a0order to diagnose carbohydrate metabolism disorders and assess the risk of developing hyperglycemia, determine in all patients: the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose fasting plasma (FPG), body mass index (BMI). And also to evaluate such risk factors as the presence of a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2), the presence of gestational diabetes in the patient's history, or the fact of the birth of children weighing more than 4 kilograms.Recently, new combinations of drugs have been actively used to treat disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, such as pioglitazone + metformin. This paper discusses the mechanism of action of PI3K inhibitors, new therapeutic combinations and their undesirable effects, and presents therapeutic experience. \u0420\u0430\u043a

        "AbstractText": "We presented the clinical case of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) associated with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) in a man under 40 years old without family history. The diagnosis of NF-1 was established based on 4 signs of the disease (multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules, scoliotic changes in posture, the presence of multiple neurofibromas, Lisch nodules). The diagnosis of PHEO was determined by a significant increase of free metanephrin/normethanephrin levels in daily urine, a malignant CT phenotype of the right adrenal tumor, and confirmed by pathomorphological study. Genetic tests revealed a new mutation in one of the alleles of NF1 gene, a deletion of a 566 bp gene fragment, including exon 19 with a size of 73 bp. This mutation leads to splicing of exons 18 and 20, frameshift, and termination of protein synthesis. A study of the level of transcription of the genes associated with PHEO (RET, TMEM127, MAX, FGFR, MET, MERTK, BRAF, NGFR, Pi3, AKT, MTOR, KRAS, MAPK) was conducted, a statistically significant decrease in the level of transcription of the KRAS and BRAF genes and increase in the level of transcription of the TMEM127 gene in comparison with control samples have been detected. This case demonstrates the need for timely recognition of NF-1 for further appropriate patient's follow up and show the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of NF-1-associated catecholamine-secreting tumors. \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0437\u0430 1 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 (\u041d\u0424-1) \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0444\u0435\u043e\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439 (\u0424\u0425\u0426) \u0443 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437 \u041d\u0424-1 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 4 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f (\u043a\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u00ab\u043a\u043e\u0444\u0435 \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u00bb, \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0437, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b, \u0443\u0437\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u0448\u0430). \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437 \u0424\u0425\u0426 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0447\u0438, \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041a\u0422-\u0444\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0412 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u0430\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 NF1 \u2014 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c 566 \u043f.\u043d., \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e 19 \u044d\u043a\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c 73 \u043f.\u043d. \u041c\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a \u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0443 18 \u0438 20 \u044d\u043a\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0441\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0443 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 RET, TMEM127, MAX, FGFR, MET, MERTK, BRAF, NGFR, Pi3, AKT, MTOR, KRAS, MAPK, \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441 \u0444\u0435\u043e\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439;

        "AbstractText": "Pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is a tumor from the chromaffin tissue of the adrenal medulla, capable of hyperproduction of catecholamines. The increased production of hormones by the tumor leads to catecholamine crises, which have a pathological effect on all organs and systems. In the primary diagnosis of pheochromocytomas, it is important to determine the level of the metabolite of catecholamines - metanephrines. Currently, in clinical practice, various methods are used to determine the level of this metabolite: in blood plasma or in urine, total or only free form, fractionated analysis or unfractionated. Comparison of the effectiveness of various methods for determining the level of metanephrines for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas. A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted on a sample of patients who were initially operated on for adrenal neoplasm at the Pirogov St. Petersburg State University High Medical Technology Clinic from November 2007 to December 2022 and who passed analysis to determine the level of blood or urine metanephrins before surgical treatment. The results of tests for metanephrine and tumor size were evaluated. 1088 patients with adrenal neoplasms who underwent surgical treatment were examined, of which 348 had histologically confirmed the presence of pheochromocytoma. Four types of metanephrine assays were compared: free fractionated plasma metanephrines (232 patients), unfractionated daily urine metanephrines (431 patients), fractionated total daily urine metanephrines (427 patients) and fractionated free daily urine metanephrines (178 patients). The greatest sensitivity was demonstrated by the analysis of free fractionated plasma methanephrines (95.4%). Unlike others, the sensitivity of this analysis did not decrease in the group of patients with small pheochromocytomas (3 cm or less). The greatest specificity was demonstrated by the analysis of unfractionated metanephrines in daily urine (97.8%), with the lowest sensitivity among all tests (67.6%). The study of fractionated total daily urine metanephrins showed good results of sensitivity and specificity, only slightly inferior to the best indicators, and the analysis of free daily urine metanephrins demonstrated unexpectedly low efficiency. There is a positive correlation between the level of metanephrine in the blood and the size of the tumor. Based on the data obtained, the preferred assays for the primary diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be considered the determination of fractionated free plasma metanephrines and fractionated total daily urine metanephrines, which is consistent with relevant clinical recommendations. It was found that the size of the tumor correlates with the severity of an increase in the level of metanephrins determined by any of the described methods.

        "AbstractText": "Currently, all pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGLs) are considered malignant due to metastatic potential. Consequently, PPGLs are divided into \u00abmetastatic\u00bb and \u00abnon-metastatic\u00bb. Metastatic PPGLs can be with synchronous metastasis (metastases appear simultaneously with the identified primary tumor) or metachronous (metastases develop after removal of the primary tumor). The term metastatic PPGLs is not used in the presence of tumor invasion into surrounding organs and tissues, without the presence of distant metastases of lymphogenic or hematogenic origin. It is generally believed that about 10% of pheochromocytomas and about 40% of sympathetic paragangliomas have metastatic potential. On average, the prevalence of PPGLs with the presence of metastases is 15-20%. Risk factors for metastatic PPGLs are widely discussed in the literature, the most significant of which are groups of clinical, morphological and genetic characteristics. The review presents a discussion of such risk factors for metastatic PPGLs as age, localization and type of hormonal secretion of the tumor, the size and growth pattern of the adrenal lesion, the presence of necrosis and invasion into the vessels, the tumor capsule surrounding adipose tissue, high cellular and mitotic activity, Ki-67 index, expression of chromogranin B and S100 protein, the presence of genetic mutations of three main clusters (pseudohypoxia, kinase signaling and Wnt signaling).Over the past two decades, a number of authors have proposed various predictor factors and scales for assessing a probability of metastatic PPGLs.

        "AbstractText": "Thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSH-PA) are a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis and account for 0.5-2% of all pituitary adenomas. Taking into account the rarity of the disease, it is extremely important to analyze each case of TSH-PA. To analyze the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with TSH-PA, as well as to determine preoperative and early postoperative factors that predict long-term remission. In a single-center retrospective study we analyzed clinical signs, laboratory and instrumental studies, as well as the treatment outcomes of patients with TSH-PA from 2010 to 2023. Preoperative factors, as well as TSH level measured on day 3 postoperatively, were evaluated for their ability to predict long-term remission when comparing groups of patients with and without remission. The study included 45 patients with TSH-PA (14 men, 31 women), with a median age of 45 years [30; 57]. The most common clinical manifestations of TSH-PA were: cardiac arrhythmia in 37 (82.2%) patients, thyroid pathology in 27 (60%), neurological disorders in 24 (53.35%). Most PAs were macroadenomas (n=35, 77.8%). Preoperatively, 28 (77.8%) patients received somatostatin analogs, and 20 (71.4%) patients were euthyroid at the time of surgery. Surgical treatment was performed in 36 (80%) patients, postoperative remission was achieved in 31 cases (86.1%). Administration of somatostatin analogues to patients with no remission/relapse after surgery lead to the remission in 100% of cases (4/4). A 1 mm increase in PA size raised the odds of recurrence/no remission by 1.15-fold,and PA invasion during surgery - by \u00a05.129 fold. A TSH level on day 3 postoperatively above 0.391 mIU/L (AUC, 0.952; 95% CI 0.873-1.000; standard error 0.04; p&lt;0.001) identifies patients with relapse/absence of remission after surgical treatment (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 88.9%). The TSH-PA in the structure of PAs is extremely rare, and as a result, most of them are misdiagnosed and detected already at the stage of macroadenoma. The most effective method of treatment is transnasal transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Somatostatin analogues can be used as second-line therapy if surgical treatment is ineffective. We have proposed a possible model for postoperative TSH levels (&gt;0.391 mU/l) to predict recurrence of TSH-PA, which requires validation on an expanded number of cases.

        "AbstractText": "Hyperprolactinemia accompanies growth hormone hypersecretion in approximately 25-39% of cases. There is a recommendation to determine the level of prolactin in clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly. However, there is no understanding of the necessity to investigate the IGF-1 level in patients with hyperprolactinemia and a pituitary adenoma. Determining the proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia and pituitary adenoma, who were examined for IGF-1 levels, and identifying the proportion of patients with acromegaly among this cohort. Between December 2019 and December 2022 a single-center observational single-stage single-sample uncontrolled study was conducted. At the first stage of the study, the proportion of patients with pituitary adenoma and hyperprolactinemia with studied IGF-1 levels was determined, according to medical records. At the second stage of the study, patients without known indicators of IGF-1 were determined. The concentration of growth hormone was studied during the oral glucose load in the case of increased IGF-1 levels. At the first stage, 105 patients were included in the study. The level of IGF-1 was determined in 41/105 (39%) cases. There were 22/41 (53.7%) cases in the subgroup with pituitary incidentalomas and 19/64 (29.7%) cases in the subgroup with hyperprolactinemia among them. At the second stage, the IGF-1 level was additionally determined in 53 patients with hyperprolactinemia and pituitary adenoma (total 94 patients). The level of IGF-1 was elevated in 11/94 patients, further acromegaly was confirmed in 3/94 patients (3.2%). In real clinical practice the level of IGF-1 is studied only in 39% of cases in patients with pituitary adenoma and hyperprolactinemia. The disease was detected in 3 cases (3.2%) out of 94 people with hyperprolactinemia and pituitary adenoma without clinical manifestations of acromegaly. We consider the study of IGF-1 levels justified as a screening for acromegaly in patients with hyperprolactinemia and pituitary adenoma.

        "AbstractText": "For malignant glioma, intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) using talaporfin sodium is a powerful tool for local tumor control, when gross total removal is performed. However, the efficacy of PDT for non-totally resectable malignant glioma has not been clearly confirmed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the usefulness of PDT using talaporfin sodium for non-totally resectable malignant glioma. Eighteen patients with malignant glioma (16 new onset, 2 recurrent) in whom gross total removal was judged to be difficult from the images obtained before surgery were evaluated. Fifteen patients had glioblastoma (14 newly diagnosed, 1 recurrent), and 3 patients had anaplastic oligodendroglioma (2 newly diagnosed, 1 recurrent). The whole resection cavity was subjected to PDT during the surgery. For newly diagnosed glioblastoma, postoperative therapy involved the combined use of radiation and temozolomide. Bevacizumab treatment was also started at an early stage after surgery. In some patients, reduction of the residual tumor was observed at an early stage of chemoradiotherapy after the surgery, suggesting the positive effect of PDT. Recurrence occurred in 15 of the 18 patients during the course of treatment. Distant recurrence occurred in 8 of these 15 patients, despite good local tumor control. In the 14 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the median progression-free survival was almost 10.5 months, and the median overall survival was almost 16.9 months. PDT for malignant glioma is expected to slightly improve local tumor control for non-totally resectable lesions.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[Adrenocortical cancer: late diagnosis of the disease on the example of a clinical case. Case report].",
        "AbstractText": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor originating in the adrenal cortex and characterized by poor 5-year survival. It occurs with a frequency of 2-4 cases per 2 million in the population. Women are more frequently affected than men and it is mostly detected in the fourth and fifth decades. In the most of cases, the cancerogenesis occurs sporadically because of gene driver mutations in somatic adrenocortical cells, in other cases it can be found as part of a genetically determined syndrome such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome or Wermer's syndrome (multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I). ACC most frequently happens occurs without symptoms in the initial stages leading to poor diagnoses. Because of this lack of early detection, the tumor is not considered malignant reducing the benefits of further treatment. Sometimes the fact that the resected tumor is indeed adrenocortical carcinoma becomes clear only after recurrence, or after the appearance of metastases. We present a case of adrenocortical carcinoma in a 46-year-old woman who went to the doctor in 1.5 year after symptoms were manfested. This clinical case illustrates the consequences of late diagnosis of a malignant tumor. We would like to emphasize the importance of timely detection of a neoplasm, using all of the potential of laboratory-instrumental and genomic analysis. Due to low oncological awareness, our patient was slow to seek medical help, which in turn led not only to metastases, but also to complications in the cardiovascular system.

        "AbstractText": "To study overall drug resistance genes (resistome) in the human gut microbiome and the changes in these genes during COVID-19 in-hospital therapy. A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted. Only cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction in oro-/nasopharyngeal swab samples were subject to analysis. The patients with a documented history of or current comorbidities of the hepatobiliary system, malignant neoplasms of any localization, systemic and autoimmune diseases, as well as pregnant women were excluded. Feces were collected from all study subjects for subsequent metagenomic sequencing. The final cohort was divided into two groups depending on the disease severity: mild (group 1) and severe (group 2). Within group 2, five subgroups were formed, depending on the use of antibacterial drugs (ABD): group 2A (receiving ABD), group 2AC (receiving ABD before hospitalization), group 2AD (receiving ABD during hospitalization), group 2AE (receiving ABD during and before hospitalization), group 2B (not receiving ABD). The median number of antibiotic resistance (ABR) genes (cumulative at all time points) was significantly higher in the group of patients treated with ABD: 81.0 (95% CI 73.8-84.5) vs. 51.0 (95% CI 31.1-68.4). In the group of patients treated with ABD (2A), the average number of multidrug resistance genes (efflux systems) was significantly higher than in controls (group 2B): 47.0 (95% CI 46.0-51.2) vs. 21.5 (95% CI 7.0-43.9). Patients with severe coronavirus infection tended to have a higher median number of ABR genes but without statistical significance. Patients in the severe COVID-19 group who did not receive ABD before and during hospitalization also had more resistance genes than the patients in the comparison group. This study demonstrated that fewer ABR genes were identified in the group with a milder disease than in the group with a more severe disease associated with more ABR genes, with the following five being the most common: SULI, MSRC, ACRE, EFMA, SAT. \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438

        "AbstractText": "Arsenic trioxide is an activist agent in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which acts alone, but has an adverse effect on patients. Moreover, deferoxamine has antiproliferative activity and induces leukopenia. In order to enhance antileukemic effectiveness and to reduce the dosage of arsenic trioxide, the combination effect of it with deferoxamine (DFO) was evaluated on the APL cell line (NB4). In this experimental study, to investigate the cytotoxic effects of ATO/DFO in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the NB4 cell line (provided by Pasteur Institute of Iran) was treated with different doses and then at 24, 48, and 72 hrs intervals, the percentage of survival, cell count, metabolic activity and apoptosis induction were investigated respectively. Also, hTERT gene expression was analyzed by the RT-PCR method. We found that DFO alone and in combination with ATO has cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects, and reduces viability and cell metabolic activity in the NB4 cell line in a dose and time-dependent manner. In addition, this combination causes an increase in apoptosis, up-regulation of Caspase-3, and down-regulation of hTERT genes in cells. Combined ATO/ DFO treatment cooperatively decreased the mRNA levels of the hTERT and increased the mRNA levels of Caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner compared to DFO alone.",

All articles that have outlined the contributions of the MCPyV to cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas were included. The six databases produced 6806 articles. Only six articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. The protocol of this review was submitted and registered with the PROSPERO (Code no. CRD42022369197). The total sample size across the articles was 1135; the age of the participants ranged between 18 and 75 years. In addition, the included articles were conducted between 2012 to 2016. All included articles have a cross-sectional design.Furthermore, different kinds of samples were collected in the reviewed articles, namely cervical tissue biopsies, cervical smears, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection specimens, and cervical adenocarcinomas. Moreover, five articles showed no statistically significant association between the MCPyV and cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast, one article revealed a positive association between MCPyV and cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. MCPyV could not be associated with the pathogenesis of cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Further attention should be given to examining this association, and further studies with a large sample size are recommended to confirm these findings.",

Social and environmental determinants of health are a useful lens through which to develop and evaluate programs to mitigate regional health disparities. This 2023 scoping review was conducted of studies linking determinants of Appalachian health with leading causes of regional mortality and morbidity. The search strategy employed a keyword search that included geographic terms for the Appalachian Region and the primary adverse health outcomes in that region. Studies meeting the following inclusion criteria were reviewed: original article, published in the last five years, involving an Appalachian population, and includes a rigorous assessment of an association between a population health determinant and one or more leading causes of Appalachian morbidity and mortality. The search returned 221 research articles, including 30 interventional studies. The top three health outcomes included cancer (43.59%), diseases of despair (23.08%), and diabetes (12.82). Access to care (27.3%), rurality (18.9%), and education (14.8%) were the most common population health determinants identified. Interventional studies were categorized by program types: education, technology, partnerships, and multilevel interventions. Due to the heterogeneity of study types, the studies were combined using a narrative synthesis. The results of this work can inform the development and evaluation of additional programs to promote Appalachian population health. Our study team will use these results to inform community-based discussions that develop strategic plans to mitigate health disparities in Central and Southcentral Appalachian Virginia.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Detection of micro-plasma-induced exosomes secretion in a fibroblast-melanoma co-culture model.",
        "AbstractText": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor and a significant cause of skin cancer-related death. Timely diagnosis and treatment require identification of specific biomarkers in exosomes secreted by melanoma cells. In this study, label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method with size-matched selectivity was used to detect membrane proteins in exosomes released from a stimulated environment of fibroblasts (L929) co-cultured with melanoma cells (B16-F10). To promote normal secretion of exosomes, micro-plasma treatment was used to gently induce the co-cultured cells and slightly increase the stress level around the cells for subsequent detection using the SERS method. Firstly, changes in reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) concentrations in the cellular microenvironment and the viability and proliferation of healthy cells are assessed. Results showed that micro-plasma treatment increased extracellular ROS/RNS levels while modestly reducing cell proliferation without significantly affecting cell survival. Secondly, the particle size of secreted exosomes isolated from the culture medium of L929, B16-F10, and co-cultured cells with different micro-plasma treatment time did not increase significantly under single-cell conditions at short treatment time but might be changed under co-culture condition or longer treatment time. Third, for SERS signals related to membrane protein biomarkers, exosome markers CD9, CD63, and CD81 can be assigned to significant Raman shifts in the range of 943-1030 and 1304-1561 cm-1, while the characteristics SERS peaks of L929 and B16-F10\u00a0cells are most likely located at 1394/1404, 1271 and 1592 cm-1 respectively. Therefore, this micro-plasma-induced co-culture model provides a promising preclinical approach to understand the diagnostic potential of exosomes secreted by cutaneous melanoma/fibroblasts. Furthermore, the label-free SERS method with size-matched selectivity provides a novel approach to screen biomarkers in exosomes secreted by melanoma cells, aiming to reduce the use of labeling reagents and the processing time traditionally required.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Investigation of calcium variations in single cells and the impact of Yoda1 on osteocytes by ICP-OES.",
        "AbstractText": "Detection of elements in individual cells by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry has recently attracted significant interest in biological research, due to the unique ability of ICP spectrometry for trace element analysis. However, performing single-cell analysis using ICP optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) remains a challenge due to the small size and discrete nature of cells. This is while ICP-OES can serve as a cost-effective and label-free method for this purpose. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the current ICP-OES technique to facilitate the detection of elements in single cells, thereby unlocking novel applications. A new conical ICP torch, which has been illustrated to offer better analytical performance than the conventional ones, was applied to achieve the detection of calcium in single micro-sized cells. A new heated chamber was designed and coupled with a high-efficiency nebulizer as the sample introduction system. For the detection of single SiO2 particles, the number of particle events obtained by the new sample introduction system was found to be up to 9 times higher than that of the conventional system without sacrificing the signal intensity. Subsequently, calcium in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), mice breast cancer cells (Py8119), and mice osteocytes (MLO-Y4) was successfully detected using the new ICP-OES system. The cell detection efficiency turned out to be around 2%-3% which is much higher than that the reported values in previous single-cell ICP-OES research. Finally, as a new application, the effect of Yoda1, a recently identified activator of Piezo1 calcium channel, on osteocytes was investigated. The calcium content in Yoda1-treated MLO-Y4 cells was seen increase by 36% compared to the control sample. This research reveals the capability of ICP-OES in single-cell analysis for micro-sized cells which was made possible by the new conical ICP torch and the new sample introduction system. The ability to detect calcium in single mammalian cells enables the first ever application of this technique to assess the impact of the Yoda1 activator on the calcium level in osteocytes.",

It is essential to develop novel methods for the highly sensitive and rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Interestingly, the combination of the property of bacteria to secrete hydrogen peroxidase, bacterial metabolism-triggered-chemiluminescence (CL)-based bioassays can be as a candidate point-of-care testing (POCT) for the detection of S. aureus against the CL substrate Luminol and hydrogen peroxide without excitation light sources. Here, a CL-based strategy with stable and visualized CL intensity was fabricated according to a hybrid biomimetic enzyme of copper-Hemin metal-organic framework, which enhances the biological enzyme activity while improving the stability and sensitivity of the assay. By further integrating S. aureus-specific capture and one-step separation of the antibody-modified Fe3O4 NPs (Fe3O4 NPs@Ab), the portable device integrated smartphone enables CL-based POCT for specific detection of S. aureus in the range of 101-106\u00a0CFU/mL with a limit of detection as low as 1\u00a0CFU/mL. Specifically, S. aureus can be eliminated after detection with high antibacterial efficiency due to the excellent photothermal properties of Fe3O4 NPs@Ab.

Herein, we demonstrate the enzymatic DNA repairing amplification-powered construction of an Au nanoparticle-based nanosensor for single-molecule monitoring of A3A activity in cancer cells. Target A3A can convert cytosine (C) in substrate probe to uracil (U), and then the template binds with substrate probe to form a dsDNA containing U/A base pairs. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) excises the U base to produce an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that can be cleaved by apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease 1 (APE1) to obtain the substrate fragment with 3'-OH end. Subsequently, the substrate fragment initiates cyclic enzymatic repairing amplification (ERA), releasing trigger-1 and trigger-2. The resultant trigger-1 can act as the primer to induce multiple cycles of cyclic ERA, producing numerous trigger-1 and trigger-2. The hybridization of trigger-2 with signal probe forms the dsDNA duplexes with an AP site, inducing the cyclic cleavage of signal probes by APE1 to release abundant Cy5 molecules from the AuNPs. Released Cy5 molecules can be easily quantified by single-molecule imaging. This nanosensor allows for specific and sensitive detection of A3A activity with a detection limit of 0.855 aM, and it can further measure kinetic parameters, screen inhibitors, and quantify endogenous A3A activity at the single-cell level, with prospect application in disease diagnostics and therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a very rare diffuse lung disease characterized by the accumulation of amorphous and periodic acid Schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces due to impaired surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. Three main types were identified: Autoimmune, secondary and congenital. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has been previously reported to be associated with several systemic auto-immune diseases. Accordingly, we present the first case report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with myasthenia gravis. Case: A 27-year-old female patient, ex-smoker, developed a dyspnea on exertion in 2020. The chest X-ray detected diffuse symmetric alveolar opacities. Pulmonary infection was ruled out, particularly COVID-19 infection. The chest scan revealed the \"crazy paving\" pattern. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed a rosy liquid with granular acellular eosinophilic material Periodic acid-Schiff positive. According to the lung biopsy results, she was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies were negative. Nine months later, she was diagnosed with bulbar seronegative myasthenia gravis, confirmed with the electroneuromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showing significant amplitude decrement of the trapezius and spinal muscles. She was treated with pyridostigmine, oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. Given the worsening respiratory condition of the patient, a bilateral whole lung lavage was performed with a partial resolution of symptoms. Thus, this previously unreported association was treated successfully with rituximab, including improvement of dyspnea, diplopia and muscle fatigability at six months of follow-up. Conclusions: This case emphasizes on the possible association of auto-immune disease to PAP, which could worsen the disease course, as the specific treatment does not exist yet. Hence, further studies are needed to establish clear-cut guidelines for PAP management, particularly when associated to auto-immune diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical care. Little is known about how radiation therapy (RT) ordering behavior changed during the pandemic. This study examined (1) whether there was a change in the rate at which orders for lumpectomy were followed by orders for RT and (2) whether there was a change in the percentage of RT orders for hypofractionated (HF) RT rather than conventionally fractionated (CF) RT. Prior authorization order data from 2019 and 2020, pertaining to patients with commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans, were reviewed to determine whether patients had an order for RT in the 90 days after lumpectomy and if it was for CF or HF RT. Univariate analyses were conducted using \u03c72 tests, and adjusted analyses were conducted using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for patient age, urbanicity, local median income, region, if the lumpectomy facility was academic, and if the lumpectomy facility was a hospital. In 2019, 47.7% of included lumpectomy orders (2200/4610) were followed by an RT order within 90 days, in contrast to 45.6% (1944/4263) in 2020 (P = .048). Of the RT orders meeting this study's definition of CF or HF, 75.3% of orders placed in 2019 (1387/1843) and 79.0% of orders placed in 2020 (1261/1597) were for HF (P = .011). Adjusted analysis found patients receiving a lumpectomy order in the first quarter of 2020 had significantly reduced odds (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99) of receiving an order for RT after lumpectomy, relative to those with orders placed in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted analysis likewise found significant evidence of increased use of HF RT during the pandemic. In the population examined, physicians were less likely to order RT after lumpectomy in 2020 than in 2019, and if they did, were more likely to order HF RT.",

        "AbstractText": "Conventional chemoradiation (CCRT) is inadequately effective for the treatment of unresectable or inoperable biliary tract cancers (UIBC). Ablative radiation therapy (AR), typically defined as a biologically effective dose (BED) \u226580.5 Gy, has shown some promise in terms of local control and survival in these patients. We compare the efficacy and toxicity of AR to non-AR in UIBC patients. Patients with UIBC treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT; n = 18) or CCRT (n = 28) between 2006 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The associations of treatment, BED groups, selected characteristics with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control were estimated separately using Cox proportional hazards regression. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Median dose fractionation was 60 Gy in 5 fractions (median BED, 127 Gy) for SBRT and 50 Gy in 25 fractions (median BED, 64 Gy) for CCRT. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 11.5 months. The 1-year OS rate was 62% for BED <80.5 versus 66% for BED \u226580.5 (P = .069). The 1-year PFS rate was 24% for BED <80.5 and 29% for BED \u226580.5 (P = .050). The 1-year local control rate was 20% for BED <80.5 and 41% for BED \u226580.5 (P = .097). BED as a continuous variable (P = .013), BED \u2265100 Gy (P = .044), and race (white versus nonwhite) (P = .037) were associated with improved overall mortality. BED \u226580.5 Gy (P = .046), smaller tumor size (<5 cm; P = .038) and N0 disease (P <.0001) were associated with improved disease progression rates. Local control was improved in patients with N0 disease compared with N1 disease (P <.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; there was no difference in acute and late toxicity between AR and non-AR. In this review, there was improved PFS with BED \u226580.5 Gy with a trend toward OS benefit. BED \u226580.5 Gy was achieved mostly through SBRT and was well tolerated. AR could be considered a more effective treatment modality than CCRT in patients with UIBC.",

        "AbstractText": "Treatment outcomes of definitive photon radiation therapy for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) are reportedly unsatisfactory. Carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) has shown favorable tumor control in various malignancies, including radioresistant tumors. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes of CIRT for nmCRPC. Patients with nmCRPC (N0M0) treated with CIRT at a total dose of 57.6 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness) in 16 fractions or 51.6 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness) in 12 fractions were included. The castration-resistant status received a diagnosis based on prostate-specific antigen kinetics showing a monotonic increase during primary androgen deprivation therapy or the need to change androgen deprivation therapy. Clinical factors associated with patient prognosis were explored. Twenty-three consecutive patients were identified from our database. The median follow-up period was 63.6 months (range, 14.1-120). Seven patients developed biochemical relapse, 6 had clinical relapse, and 4 died of the disease. The 5-year overall survival, local control rate, biochemical relapse-free survival, and clinical relapse-free survival were 87.5%, 95.7%, 70.3%, and 75.7%, respectively. One patient with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin injections and taking antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs developed grade 3 hematuria and bladder tamponade after CIRT. None of the patients developed grade 4 or worse toxicity. The present findings indicate the acceptable safety and favorable efficacy of CIRT, encouraging further research on CIRT for nmCRPC.",

        "AbstractText": "The landmark randomized trial on chest irradiation in extensive disease small cell lung cancer (CREST) demonstrated that consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) improved overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after initial chemotherapy (chemo) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, with potentially increased benefit in women compared with men. It is unknown whether similar findings would apply after chemoimmunotherapy became the standard first-line treatment. In this analysis, we report national practice patterns and survival outcomes of cTRT according to patient sex. We included patients from de-identified electronic health record-derived database diagnosed with stage IV small cell lung cancer (2014-2021) who completed 4 to 6 cycles of first-line systemic therapy (platinum-doublet chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy). We evaluated OS and PFS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with receipt of cTRT as an independent variable and stratified by sex. As a sensitivity analysis, we weighted the models by the inverse probability of receiving cTRT. A total of 1227 patients were included (850 chemotherapy, 377 chemoimmunotherapy). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients who did and did not receive cTRT. Among women, cTRT was associated with superior OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) and PFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82) compared with those not receiving cTRT. Conversely, no OS or PFS benefit with cTRT was observed in men (OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.31; PFS HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85-1.47). Findings were similar in weighted analyses. The survival efficacy of cTRT may be moderated by sex, with female patients appearing more likely to benefit than male patients. These findings reflect sex-based survival trends with similar effect sizes to those observed in the CREST trial. Although the underpinnings of this association need to be elucidated, stratification by sex should be considered for randomized-controlled trials studying cTRT in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Ichthyosporea, a clade of holozoans, represent a clade closely related to animals, and thus hold a key phylogenetic position for understanding the origin of animals. We have previously discovered that an ichthyosporean, Sphaeroforma arctica, contains microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as the miRNA processing machinery. This was the first discovery of miRNAs among the closest single-celled relatives of animals and raised intriguing questions about the roles of regulatory small RNAs in cell development and differentiation in unicellular eukaryotes. Like many ichthyosporeans, S. arctica also undergoes a transient multicellular developmental life cycle. As miRNAs are, among other roles, key regulators of gene expression during development in animals, we wanted to investigate the dynamics of miRNAs during the developmental cycle in S. arctica. Here we have therefore collected a comprehensive time-resolved small RNA transcriptome linked to specific life stages with a substantially higher sequencing depth than before, which can enable further discovery of functionally relevant small RNAs. The data consists of Illumina-sequenced small RNA libraries from two independent biological replicates of the entire life cycle of S. arctica with high temporal resolution. The dataset is directly linked and comes from the same samples as a previously published mRNA-seq dataset, thus enabling direct cross-functional analyses.",

Of the 377 robust\u2010cycling genes that we identified, only a minor fraction is regulated solely by either dynamic transcription or degradation (6 and 4%, respectively). By contrast, the vast majority (89%) exhibit dynamically regulated transcription and degradation rates during the cell cycle. Our study thus shows that temporally regulated mRNA degradation is fundamental for the correct expression of a majority of cycling genes. SLAM\u2010Drop\u2010seq, combined with Eskrate, is a powerful approach to understanding the underlying mRNA kinetics of single\u2010cell gene expression dynamics in continuous biological processes.",

Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, have gained attention because of their potential anticancer properties. This study investigated the anticancer and cytotoxic effects of postbiotic mediators (PMs) derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PMs were prepared by culturing LGG and LR strains and isolating the supernatant. The MTT assay assessed cell viability on ALL Jurkat cells and PBMCs, and apoptosis analysis was conducted using flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR was also performed to analyze BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels. The results showed that PMs derived from LGG and LR significantly reduced cell viability in Jurkat cells (P0.05) but not PBMCs (P0.05). Apoptosis analysis revealed an increase in apoptotic cells after PMs treatment. Nevertheless, gene expression analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the treated and untreated groups in BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels (P0.05). Findings suggest that specific PMs derived from LGG and LR possess anticancer properties against ALL cells.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Five-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 5ARIs prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is important in prostate development. It has been suggested that 5ARIs can be used a chemopreventative agent for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of prostate cancer associated with 5ARI use among men with BPH. Methods: Using Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1992 to 2011 in UK, prostate cancer risk was retrospectively compared in men with a new diagnosis of BPH, with no history of prostate cancer who were treated with 5ARIs, to men treated with alpha blockers (ABs) and those given no pharmacological treatment. Incidence rate of prostate cancer was calculated by treatment group; the association between BPH treatment group and prostate cancer was estimated by a multivariate Cox model. Results: 77,494 men with newly diagnosed BPH were included. The crude incidence rate of prostate cancer was 892.4 cases per 100,000 person-years amongst those treated with 5ARIs, compared with 1209.0 and 1542.9 in those treated with ABs and untreated individuals, respectively. The HR adjusted for potential confounders was 0.79 (0.72-0.86) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.72 (0.66-0.79) for 5ARI vs untreated. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, adjusted HRs attenuated to 0.87 (0.79-0.97) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.97 (0.87-1.08) for 5ARI vs untreated. Conclusion: Among men diagnosed with BPH, we found evidence of lower risks of subsequent prostate cancer in those treated with 5ARIs, but this appeared to be driven by cases diagnosed within a year of BPH, possibly reflecting prevalent prostate cancers that were initially misdiagnosed. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, there was little evidence of a reduced prostate cancer risk in those taking 5ARIs.",

Standard systematic review methodology aimed at limiting bias was used for study identification (to January 2022), selection and data extraction. Thematic synthesis was undertaken for qualitative data, and survey findings were tabulated and described. Nine qualitative studies and 22 surveys were included, mainly in breast and endometrial cancer. Women treated for breast or endometrial cancer and HCPs were mostly supportive of PIFU. Facilitators for PIFU included convenience, control over own health and avoidance of anxiety-inducing clinic appointments. Barriers included loss of reassurance from scheduled visits and lack of confidence in self-management. HCPs were supportive of PIFU but concerned about resistance to change, unsuitability of PIFU for some patients and costs. PIFU is viewed mostly positively by women treated for breast or endometrial cancer, and by HCPs, but further evidence is needed from a wider range of cancers, men, and more representative samples.

Especially, such mechanical cues can alter cellular DNA transcription and give rise to a subpopulation of tumor cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs). These CSCs with stem-like properties are critical drivers of tumorigenesis, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Yet, the biophysical and molecular machinery underlying the emergence of CSCs in tumor remained unexplored. This work employed a two-dimensional micropatterned multicellular model to examine the impact of mechanical constraints arisen from geometric confinement on the emergence and spatial patterning of CSCs in GBM tumor. Our study identified distinct spatial distributions of GBM CSCs in different geometric patterns, where CSCs mostly emerged in the peripheral regions. The spatial pattern of CSCs was found to correspond to the gradients of mechanical stresses resulted from the interplay between the cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions within the confined environment. Further mechanistic study highlighted a Piezo1-RhoA-focal adhesion signaling axis in regulating GBM cell mechanosensing and the subsequent CSC phenotypic transformation. These findings provide new insights into the biophysical origin of the unique spatial pattern of CSCs in GBM tumor and offer potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.",

This heterogeneous disease is currently broadly classified as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) positive luminal tumors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified tumors and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Phytochemicals are proven to be promising anti-cancer chemotherapeutics agents with minimal cytotoxic effects on normal cells. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) is a phytochemical derived from the roots of Plumbago zeylanica and it is known to possess anti-cancer properties similar to other compounds of naphthoquinones. In about 90% of cancer cells, the telomerase enzyme activity is revived to add telomeric repeats to evade apoptosis. In this study, a combinatorial approach of combining the anti-cancer compound plumbagin to induce genotoxicity and a potent telomerase inhibitor, MST-312 (synthetic derivative of tea catechins), was used to determine the combinational treatment-induced lethality in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) and MCF-7 (lumina) cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were responsive to combination treatment in both short-term (48 h) and long-term treatment (14 days) in a synergistic manner, whereas in MCF-7, the combination treatment was more effective in the long-term regimen. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of the plumbagin and MST-312 combination treatment were not recoverable after the short-term treatment. In conclusion, a combination treatment of MST-312 and plumbagin is proven to be more effective than a single plumbagin compound treatment in inducing DNA damage and telomere dysfunction leading to greater genome instability, cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death in cancer cells.",

A thoracic epidural analgesia was performed prior to general anesthesia. Postoperative pain was controlled with patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with ropivacaine-epinephrine. During the first night, abdominal pain appeared. During the second day, a nurse discovered that the bag connected to the pump contained ciprofloxacin and not ropivacaine. After aspiration of 2.5\u2009ml sent to laboratory for analysis, the epidural catheter was removed. The investigation revealed the different causes leading to such an error. Three days after, the patient returned home, without any adverse symptoms. Conclusion: This is the first report of the inadvertent administration of ciprofloxacin into the epidural space via a patient-controlled epidural analgesia technique. As there is no effective treatment for such errors, we discuss the neurological risk of ciprofloxacin and prevention strategy mainly based on organizational and human factors.",

        "AbstractText": "Data science education provides tremendous opportunities but remains inaccessible to many communities. Increasing the accessibility of data science to these communities not only benefits the individuals entering data science, but also increases the field's innovation and potential impact as a whole. Education is the most scalable solution to meet these needs, but many data science educators lack formal training in education. Our group has led education efforts for a variety of audiences: from professional scientists to high school students to lay audiences. These experiences have helped form our teaching philosophy which we have summarized into three main ideals: 1) motivation, 2) inclusivity, and 3) realism. 20 we also aim to iteratively update our teaching approaches and curriculum as we find ways to better reach these ideals. In this manuscript we discuss these ideals as well practical ideas for how to implement these philosophies in the classroom.",

We pooled data from 15 studies in the Biliary Tract Cancers Pooling Project to evaluate associations between tea and coffee consumption and biliary tract cancer development. We categorized participants as nondrinkers (0 cup/day), moderate drinkers (>0 and <3 cups/day), and heavy drinkers (\u22653 cups/day). We estimated multivariable HRs and 95% CIs using Cox models. During 29,911,744 person-years of follow-up, 851 gallbladder, 588 intrahepatic bile duct, 753 extrahepatic bile duct, and 458 ampulla of Vater cancer cases were diagnosed. Individuals who drank tea showed a statistically significantly lower incidence rate of gallbladder cancer (GBC) relative to tea nondrinkers (HR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91), and intrahepatic bile duct cancer (IHBDC) had an inverse association (HR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-1.00). However, no associations were observed for extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EHBDC) or ampulla of Vater cancer (AVC). In contrast, coffee consumption was positively associated with GBC, with a higher incidence rate for individuals consuming more coffee (HR<3 cups/day =1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.66; HR\u22653 cups/day =1.49; 95% CI, 1.11-1.99, Ptrend=0.01) relative to coffee nondrinkers. However, there was no association between coffee consumption and GBC when restricted to coffee drinkers. There was little evidence of associations between coffee consumption and other biliary tract cancers. Tea consumption was associated with a lower incidence of GBC and possibly IHBDC. Further research is warranted to replicate the observed positive association between coffee and GBC.",

U.S. payers' coverage policies will impact MCED test adoption and access; thus, their perspectives must be understood. We examined views, coverage barriers, and evidentiary needs for MCED from 19 private payers collectively covering 150 000 000 enrollees. Most saw an MCED test's potential merit for cancers without current screening (84%), but fewer saw its merit for cancers with existing screening (37%). The largest coverage barriers were inclusion of cancers without demonstrated benefits of early diagnosis (73%), a high false-negative rate (53%), and lack of care protocols for MCED-detected but unconfirmed cancers (53%). The majority (58%) would not require mortality evidence and would accept surrogate endpoints. Most payers (64%) would accept rigorous real-world evidence in the absence of a large randomized controlled trial. The majority (74%) did not expect MCED to reduce disparities due to potential harm from overtreatment resulting from an MCED and barriers to downstream care. Payers' perspectives and evidentiary needs may inform MCED test developers, researchers producing evidence, and health systems framing MCED screening programs.

Among 3404 patients meeting eligibility criteria, following an initial \"rising-risk\" period of 3 hospitalizations in 6 months, growth mixture modeling discerned 4 clusters of subsequent hospitalization trajectories: no further utilization, low chronic utilization, persistently high utilization with a slow rate of increase, and persistently high utilization with a fast rate of increase. Baseline factors associated with higher-order hospitalization trajectories included admission to a nonsurgical service, full code status, intensive care unit-level care, opioid administration, discharge home, and comorbid cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney or liver disease, or cancer. Characterizing hospitalization trajectories and their correlates in this manner lays groundwork for early identification of those most likely to become high-need, high-cost patients.",

Due to limited data available on LMC from India, we conducted a country-wise audit of LMC across 15 centres in India. The current study conducted in 2020, was a retrospective, multicentric audit of adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with diagnosis of LMC and who received treatment during 2010-2020. Baseline characteristics, details related to previous treatments, cancer sites, LMC diagnosis, treatment pattern and overall survival (OS) were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed, and Kaplan Meier analysis was performed for the estimation of OS. Among the patients diagnosed with LMC (n\u00a0=\u00a084), diagnosis was confirmed in 52 patients (61.9%) and 'probable' in 32 (38.1%) patients. The three most common cause of malignancy were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer with 45 (53.6%), 22 (26.1%) and 9 (10.7%) patients respectively. Intrathecal therapy was offered in 33 patients (39.3%). The most common intrathecal agent was methotrexate in 23 patients (27.4%). The median OS was 90 days (95% CI 48-128).

Despite decreasing incidence rates, cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer in India, accounting for 10% of all female cancers. The objective of the study is to estimate the five-year survival of patients with cervical cancer diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 from the PBCRs in India. A single primary incidence of cervical cancer cases of 11 PBCRs (2012-2015) was followed till June 30, 2021 (n\u00a0=\u00a05591). Active follow-ups were conducted through hospital visits, telephone calls, home or field visits, and public databases. Five-year Observed Survival (OS) and Age Standardised Relative Survival (ASRS) was calculated. OS was measured by age and clinical extent of disease for cervical cancers. The five-year ASRS (95% CI) of cervical cancer was 51.7% (50.2%-53.3%). Ahmedabad urban (61.5%; 57.4%-65.4%) had a higher survival followed by Thiruvananthapuram (58.8%; 53.1%-64.3%) and Kollam (56.1%; 50.7%-61.3%). Tripura had the lowest overall survival rate (31.6%; 27.2%-36.1%). The five-year OS% for pooled PBCRs was 65.9%, 53.5%, and 18.0% for localised, regional, and distant metastasis, respectively. We observed a wide variation in cervical cancer survival within India. The findings of this study would help the policymakers to identify and address inequities in the health system.

This study aims to depict the evolving landscape of cancer clinical trials in India by analysing the clinical trials registered in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI). We identified cancer trials registered in CTRI (between 2007 and 2021) using search terms adapted from the cancer types defined by the National Cancer Institute (USA). We then collated and analysed the publicly available information from CTRI (cancer subtypes, type of trial, treatment intent, type of intervention, sponsor type, recruitment countries) and used descriptive statistics to illustrate the overall as well as year-to-year trend. In total, we identified 1988 cancer trials, the majority of which focused on treating cancer (63%) and rest of the trials aimed at optimising the operational aspects of surgery (19%), mitigating treatment-related toxicity (10.6%), or treating cancer-related symptoms (7.8%). Focusing on trials with the intent of treating cancer, we found that most were investigating solid tumours as opposed to haematological malignancies with the most prominent cancer subtypes being breast cancer (17%), head and neck cancer (9.8%), lung cancer (9.6%), and cervical cancer (6.6%). The number of trials conducted in a given cancer subtype from our analysis overall correlated to the incidence, mortality, and 5-year prevalence of the respective cancer subtype in India; however, head and neck cancer and cervical cancer were underrepresented in trials as compared with the disease burden. The most common type of intervention was investigational drugs. The most common sponsor types were global pharmaceutical industry (26%) and research institution and hospital (26%). Despite a relatively high cancer burden, the availability of cancer trials in the Northeastern states of India was limited. There is a pressing need for clinical cancer research in India to be better aligned with the nation's healthcare needs and disease burden, focusing on prevalent and deadly cancers while ensuring the availability of clinical trials across geographic regions and underserved populations.

We compared the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab/becavizumab treatment in patients with unresectable HCC and various degrees of liver dysfunction. A total of 8 retrospective, non-randomized, cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis, for a total of 1,071 Child-Pugh A and 225 Child-Pugh B patients.

        "AbstractText": "Intratumoral administration of pexa-vec (pexastimogene devacirepvec), an oncolytic and immunotherapeutic vaccinia virus, given to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is associated with both local and distant tumor responses. We hypothesized subsequent treatment with sorafenib could demonstrate superior efficacy. This random phase III open-label study evaluated the sequential treatment with pexa-vec followed by sorafenib compared to sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and no prior systemic treatment. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Key secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival, overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). Safety was assessed in all patients who received \u22651 dose of study treatment. The study was conducted at 142 sites in 16 countries. From December 30, 2015, to the interim analysis on August 2, 2019, 459 patients were randomly assigned (pexa-vec plus sorafenib: 234, sorafenib: 225). At the interim analysis, the median OS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.89, 14.95) in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib arm and 14.0 months (95% CI: 11.01, 18.00) in the sorafenib arm. This led to the early termination of the study. The median TTP was 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.77, 2.96) and 4.2 months (95% CI: 2.92, 4.63); ORR was 19.2% (45 patients) and 20.9% (47 patients); and DCR was 50.0% (117 patients) and 57.3% (129 patients) in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib and sorafenib arms, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 117 (53.7%) patients in the pexa-vec plus sorafenib and 77 (35.5%) patients in the sorafenib arm. Liver failure was the most frequently reported in both groups. Sequential pexa-vec plus sorafenib treatment did not demonstrate increased clinical benefit in advanced HCC and fared worse compared to sorafenib alone. The advent of the added value of checkpoint inhibitors should direct any further development of oncolytic virus therapy strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. While there has been rapid evolution in the treatment paradigm of HCC across the past decade, the extent to which these newly approved therapies are utilized in clinical practice in the real world is, however, unknown. The INSIGHT study was an investigator-initiated, multi-site longitudinal cohort study conducted to reflect real-world epidemiology and clinical practice in Asia-Pacific in the immediate 7-year period after the conclusion of the BRIDGE study. Data were collected both retrospectively (planned 30% of the total cohort size) and prospectively (planned 70%) from January 2013 to December 2019 from eligible patients newly diagnosed with HCC from 33 participating sites across 9 Asia-Pacific countries. A total of 2,533 newly diagnosed HCC patients (1,052 in retrospective cohort and 1,481 in prospective cohort) were enrolled. The most common risk factor was hepatitis B in all countries except Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, where the prevalence of hepatitis C and diabetes were more common. The top three comorbidities reported in the INSIGHT study include cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes. We observe high heterogeneity in the first-line treatment recorded across countries and across disease stages, which significantly affects survival outcomes. Stratification by factors such as etiologies, tumor characteristics, the presence of extrahepatic metastases or macrovascular invasion, and the use of subsequent lines of treatment were performed. The INSIGHT study describes a wide spectrum of clinical management practices in HCC, where patient demographics, differential costs, and patient access to therapies may lead to wide geographical variations through the patient's treatment cycle, from diagnosis to clinical outcome. The high heterogeneity in patient outcomes demonstrates the need for more robust and clinical management strategies to be designed and adopted to bring about better patient outcomes.",

The animals were divided into six equal groups. Animals in the control group (n = 10) did not receive any treatment. The animals in the experimental group were administered Ivermectin [three times a week, n = 10, subcutaneous, (SC)], Tarantula cubensis extract (twice a week, n = 10, SC), autologous vaccine (three times at 10-day intervals, n = 10, SC), levamisole [twice at one-week intervals, n = 10, intramuscular (IM)], and levamisole + Tarantula cubensis extract (concurrently). All animals used in the study were monitored for three months at an interval of 15 days. No regression was detected in the papillomas of the control group animals, but recovery was recorded in animals treated with ivermectin at a rate of 70% (7/10), while it was 60% (6/10) in those treated with T. cubensis extract, 100% (10/10) in those treated with autovaccine, 50% (5/10) in those treated with levamisole, and 90% (9/10) in those treated with the combination of T. cubensis extract + levamisole. Significant differences were found between the control group and all treatment groups. Recovery mostly occurred within 45-60 days (P < 0.05). The five treatment modalities applied for the treatment of bovine cutaneous papillomatosis were statistically evaluated and all methods of treatment were effective at different rates. The most precise and effective treatment method was the autovaccine one.",

All images were reviewed by a radiologist fellowship trained in both breast imaging and cardiothoracic radiology (MS). Ultrasound characterization of lesion density as cystic or solid was considered the gold standard for this study. Analysis of CT scans was performed to identify lesions of interest corresponding to ultrasound abnormality; average, minimum, and maximum Hounsfield units (HUs) were measured. If masses had any solid component, they were considered solid. Twenty masses were solid, and 7 masses were cystic on ultrasound. Thirteen studies were performed without contrast and 14 were performed with contrast. On non-contrast studies, the average HU for cystic lesions was 19 compared to 38 HU for solid (P=0.007). On contrast studies, the average HU for cystic lesions was 16 compared to 53 HU for solid (P=0.002). Cystic lesions did not change with contrast significantly.

TORCHLIGHT is the first phase III trial of PD-1 inhibitor combined chemotherapy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in China, evaluating the efficacy and safety of toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel as first- or second-line therapy. Nab-paclitaxel has significant advantages over other chemotherapy drugs, as paclitaxel nanoparticles combine with natural albumin to increase drug delivery and bioavailability of paclitaxel. Firstly, nab-paclitaxel has a higher therapy response; Secondly, albumin carries paclitaxel out of the blood circulation faster, reducing the damage to normal tissues, ensuring the survival of more normal immune cells and exerting immune efficacy. Finally, nab-paclitaxel does not cause allergic reactions caused by organic solvents and does not require glucocorticoid pretreatment, avoiding immune suppression and ensuring the maximum efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In TORCHLIGHT trial, 95% of subjects were on the first line treatment, with only 5% being on the second line, and 56% patients were programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive in total population. It achieved the survival benefits of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) dual efficacy end points, which stood out among numerous ICIs in advanced TNBC.

The programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway is pivotal in immune regulation, and its inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic benefits in diverse tumors. This review aims to critically examine the role, clinical efficacy, safety, and future directions of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment, with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and tislelizumab, and to elucidate the challenges and prospects in this dynamic field. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, adhering to Narrative Review reporting checklist for transparent reporting. Data from selected studies were qualitatively analyzed to synthesize key findings related to the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and challenges of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer. PD-1 inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in various malignancies, including advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where they have been investigated both in combination with chemotherapy and as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment. The exploration of these inhibitors in other breast cancer subtypes, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, is ongoing. The review highlights the challenges in patient selection, management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and the emergence of resistance mechanisms. It underscores the need for ongoing research focusing on identifying reliable predictive biomarkers, elucidating mechanisms of resistance, and optimizing treatment strategies. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors hold substantial promise in advancing breast cancer treatment. This review provides critical insights and emphasizes the clinical importance of continued scientific exploration to refine patient selection criteria, improve treatment outcomes, and expand the applications of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Further research is imperative to overcome the existing challenges and realize the full therapeutic potential of these inhibitors in breast cancer and other malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in women worldwide and one of the leading causes of female death. The triple-negative subtype, characterized by the absence of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tends to occur in younger patients, be more aggressive and less differentiated. Furthermore, this subtype is considered the most immunogenic and associated with higher levels of tumor cell infiltration, mainly lymphocytes. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play a crucial role in the interaction of the host's immune system and cancer cells. The microenvironment is critical in tumor development and progression. Assessment of infiltrating lymphocytes can provide valuable information about the immune response and, given the lack of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes in triple-negative tumors and can be considered as a potential biomarker. Some evidence suggests that higher levels of these lymphocytes are associated with better responses to systemic treatment, longer progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). However, treatment escalation or de-escalation strategies for triple-negative BC (TNBC) currently do not consider the presence or density of TILs for therapeutic decisions. TILs appear to be useful predictive and prognostic indicators. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these relationships and integrate TILs as a biomarker consistently into clinical practice. This article summarizes key concepts relating to the role of the immune infiltrate in BC, along with the current status and future prospects regarding TILs as a predictive and prognostic biomarker.",

The PROMPPT (Proactive clinical Review of patients taking Opioid Medicines long-term for persistent Pain led by clinical Pharmacists in primary care Teams) research programme aims to develop and test a pharmacist-led pain review (PROMPPT) to reduce inappropriate opioid use for persistent pain in primary care. This study explored the acceptability of the proposed PROMPPT review to inform early intervention development. Interviews (n = 15) and an online discussion forum (n = 31) with patients prescribed opioids for PCNP and interviews with pharmacists (n = 13), explored acceptability of a proposed PROMPPT review. A prototype PROMPPT review was then tested and refined through 3 iterative cycles of in-practice testing (IPT) (n = 3 practices, n = 3 practice pharmacists, n = 13 patients). Drawing on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA), a framework was generated (including a priori TFA constructs) allowing for deductive and inductive thematic analysis to identify aspects of prospective and experienced acceptability. Patients felt uncertain about practice pharmacists delivering the proposed PROMPPT review leading to development of content for the invitation letter for IPT (introducing the pharmacist and outlining the aim of the review). After IPT, patients felt that pharmacists were suited to the role as they were knowledgeable and qualified. Pharmacists felt that the proposed reviews would be challenging. Although challenges were experienced during delivery of PROMPPT reviews, pharmacists found that they became easier to deliver with time, practise and experience. Recommendations for optimisations after IPT included development of the training to include examples of challenging consultations. Uptake of new healthcare interventions is influenced by perceptions of acceptability. Exploring prospective and experienced acceptability at multiple time points during early intervention development, led to mini-optimisations of the prototype PROMPPT review ahead of a non-randomised feasibility study.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic pain is associated with a poor health-related quality of life (HRQL). Whereas the prescription rate of opioids increased during the last decades, their use in chronic non-malignant pain remains unclear. However, there is currently no clinical consensus or evidence-based guidelines that consider the long-term effects of opioid therapy on HRQL in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. This systematic review aims to address the question of whether opioid therapy improves HRQL in patients with chronic non-malignant pain and provide some guidance to practitioners. PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched in June 2020 for double-blind, randomized trials (RCTs), comparing opioid therapy to placebo and assessed a HRQL questionnaire. The review comprises a qualitative vote counting approach and a meta-analysis of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), EQ-5D questionnaire and the pain interference scale of the Brief pain inventory (BPI). 35 RCTs were included, of which the majority reported a positive effect of opioids for the EQ-5D, the BPI and the physical component score (PCS) of the SF-36 compared to placebo. The meta-analysis of the PCS showed a mean difference of 1.82 [confidence interval: 1.32, 2.32], the meta-analysis of the EQ-5D proved a significant advantage of 0.06 [0.00, 0.12]. In the qualitative analysis of the mental component score (MCS) of the SF-36, no positive or negative trend was seen. No significant differences were seen in the MCS (MD: 0.65 [-0.43, 1.73]). A slightly higher premature dropout rate was found in the opioid group (risk difference: 0.04 [0.00, 0.07], p = .07). The body of evidence is graded as low to medium. Opioids have a statistically significant, but small and clinical not relevant effect on the physical dimensions of HRQL, whereas there is no effect on mental dimensions of HRQL in patients with chronic non-malignant pain during the initial months of treatment. In clinical practice, opioid prescriptions for chronic non-cancer pain should be individually assessed as their broad efficacy in improving quality of life is not confirmed. The duration of opioid treatment should be determined carefully, as this review primarily focuses on the initial months of therapy.",

In this multicenter international retrospective study, cirrhotic patients treated with lenvatinib for aHCC, were enrolled if upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy was available within 6 months before treatment. Primary endpoint was the incidence of EGV bleeding during lenvatinib therapy; secondary endpoints were predictors for EGV bleeding, prevalence, and risk factors for the presence of EGV and high-risk EGV at baseline, as well as impact of EGV bleeding on patients' survival. 535 patients were enrolled in the study (median age: 72 years, 78% male, 63% viral etiology, 89% Child-Pugh A, 16% neoplastic portal vein thrombosis [nPVT], 56% Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C): 234 had EGV (44%), 70 (30%) were at high risk and 59 were on primary prophylaxis.

        "AbstractText": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. So far, standard systemic therapy for advanced iCCA has been a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. However, recent advancements in the understanding of the molecular characteristics of iCCA have opened new possibilities for molecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Reportedly, 9-36% of iCCA cases have an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment (TME) based on the immune gene expression signature, which is characterized by the presence of immune cells involved in anti-tumor immune responses. The majority of iCCA cases have a non-inflamed TME with a lack of effector T cells, rendering immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ineffective in these cases. Interestingly, alterations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR2) gene and IDH1/2 gene mutations are often observed in the non-inflamed TME in iCCA. Several mechanisms have been reported for the role of driver mutations on the establishment of TME unique for iCCA. For example, IDH1/2 mutations, which cause an increase in DNA methylation, are associated with the downregulation and hypermethylation of antigen processing and presentation machinery, which may contribute to the establishment of a non-inflamed TME. Therefore, inhibitors targeting IDH1/2 may restore the DNA methylation and expression status of molecules involved in antigen presentation, potentially improving the efficacy of ICIs. FGFR inhibitors may also have the potential to modulate immunosuppressive TME by inhibitingthe suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and activating the interferon-\u03b3 signaling as a consequence of inhibition of the FGFR signal. From this perspective, understanding the molecular characteristics of iCCA, including the TME and driver mutations, is essential for the effective application of ICIs and molecular-targeted therapies. Combination approaches that target both the tumor and immune system hold promise for improving the outcomes of patients with iCCA. Further research and clinical trials are needed to validate these approaches and optimize the treatment strategies for iCCA.",

        "AbstractText": "Microvascular invasion (MVI) is one of the most important prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, but its application in preoperative clinical decisions is limited. This study aimed to identify preoperative predictive factors for MVI in HCC and further evaluate oncologic outcomes of different types and extents of hepatectomy according to stratified risk of MVI. Patients with surgically resected single HCC (\u22645 cm) who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in a single-center retrospective study. Two radiologists reviewed the images with no clinical, pathological, or prognostic information. Significant predictive factors for MVI were identified using logistic regression analysis against pathologic MVI and used to stratify patients. In the subgroup analysis, long-term outcomes of the stratified patients were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and compared between anatomical and nonanatomical or major and minor resection. A total of 408 patients, 318 men and 90 women, with a mean age of 56.7 years were included. Elevated levels of tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [\u03b1-FP] \u226525 ng/mL and PIVKA-II \u226540 mAU/mL) and three MRI features (tumor size \u22653 cm, non-smooth tumor margin, and arterial peritumoral enhancement) were independent predictive factors for MVI. As the MVI risk increased from low (no predictive factor) and intermediate (1-2 factors) to high-risk (3-4 factors), recurrence-free and overall survival of each group significantly decreased (p = 0.001). In the high MVI risk group, 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was significantly lower in patients who underwent major compared to minor hepatectomy (26.6 vs. 59.8%, p = 0.027). Tumor markers and MRI features can predict the risk of MVI and prognosis after hepatectomy.

A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October 31, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including sorafenib and lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time. A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade \u22653 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in SAE probability divided by survival difference between the 2 most effective treatments. Nine RCTs enrolling 6,600 patients were included. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of achieving the 30-month OS landmark. Lenvatinib showed a probability of 86% of achieving best PFS outcomes. ICI monotherapies ranked as most tolerable. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the best net health benefit for OS, compared to durvalumab plus tremelimumab. When evaluating the net health benefit for PFS, at a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for life-month gained, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was favoured in 78% of cases, while at threshold of 30% of SAEs for life-month gained, lenvatinib was favoured in 76% of cases. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is the best treatment in terms of net benefit and therefore it should be recommended as standard of care. Compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, lenvatinib monotherapy had the best net benefit for PFS when physicians and patients are available to accept a higher risk of toxicity.",

Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were compared according to fibrosis stage. Moreover, postoperative outcomes were subjected to analysis in cohorts of patients with F0 and F1-3, as well as in those with F1-3 and F4, who were carefully matched for background factors. The 5-year RFS exhibited a significantly worse outcome in the F4 group compared to other stages of fibrosis: 5-year RFS - F0 (46.6%), F1-3 (33.1%), and F4 (23.5%), p = 0.03 (F0 vs. F1-3) and p < 0.01 (F1-3 vs. F4).

There was a significantly higher incidence of multiple recurrences in the F4 group than the F1-3 group, and a number of recurrences were observed both in the same hepatic segment as the resected side and in the contralateral lobe in F4 group. The hazard and recurrence pattern of HCC signifies that the prognosis could potentially be poor, as the hepatic fibrosis likely owing to a higher hepatocarcinogenic potential, even in the absence of progression to cirrhotic condition.

The Child-Pugh class was A (n = 46), B (n = 7), and unknown (n = 6); the median maximum tumor diameter was 5.0 cm (range 2.0-15.2 cm); and the clinical stage was I (n = 12), II (n = 19), III (n = 10), and IV (n = 18). At the last follow-up, 17 patients were alive (median follow-up: 36.7 months; range: 24.1-49.9 months) and 42 had died. The median OS was 21.7 months (95% CI: 14.8-34.4 months). At the last follow-up, 37 cases had recurrence, including 10 with local recurrence. The median PFS was 7.5 months (95% CI: 6.1-11.3 months). In multivariable analyses, Child-Pugh class was significantly associated with OS and PFS, and Child-Pugh class and hepatitis were significantly associated with local recurrence. Four patients (6.8%) had late adverse events of grade 3 or higher. PBT gives favorable treatment outcomes for unresectable ICC without distant metastasis and may be particularly effective in cases with large tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is unknown and there is no validated diagnostic work-up to define the liver nodules with arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), suggesting malignancy. This prospective study evaluates HCC incidence in a Western cohort of patients with BCS and assesses the performance of MRI with hepatobiliary contrast (HB-MRI) for nodule characterization. Patients with BCS followed in our hospital were prospectively evaluated by MRI with extracellular contrast (EC-MRI). Nodules with APHE categorized as non-conclusively benign by 2 radiologists were studied by HB-MRI and reviewed by 2 radiologists blinded to the EC-MRI results. A new EC-MRI 1 year later and clinical, analytical, and sonographic follow-up every 6 months for a median of 10 years was performed. A total of 55 non-conclusively benign nodules with APHE were detected at EC-MRI in 41 patients. While 32 of them were suggestive of HCC by EC-MRI, all the 55 nodules showed increased uptake of hepatobiliary contrast. An unequivocal central scar was seen in 12/55 nodules at HB-MRI regardless of it was not detected on the EC-MRI. None of the nodules was hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP). HCC was not detected during a median of 10 years of follow-up. Detection of nodules with APHE is frequent in patients with BCS, but HCC is rare in Western patients with BCS. While EC-MRI may detect nodules suggesting malignancy, the identification of contrast uptake in the HBP at HB-MRI may help categorize them as benign.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with cisplatin and lenvatinib exhibits strong antitumor effects against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Higher antitumor activity is expected for the combination treatment. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with HAIC using cisplatin in patients with advanced HCC. In this multicenter, open-labeled, single-arm, phase II trial, patients with advanced HCC categorized as Child-Pugh class A with no prior history of systemic therapy were enrolled. Patients received lenvatinib plus HAIC with cisplatin (lenvatinib: 12 mg once daily for patients \u226560 kg, 8 mg once daily for patients <60 kg; HAIC with cisplatin: 65 mg/m2, day 1, every 4-6 weeks, maximum of six cycles). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed using modified RECIST by the Independent Review Committee. The secondary endpoints were the ORR assessed using RECIST v1.1, progression-free survival, overall survival, and frequency of adverse events associated with the treatment. A total of 36 patients were enrolled between September 2018 and March 2020. In the 34 evaluable patients, the ORR assessed by the Independent Review Committee using modified RECIST and RECIST v1.1 were 64.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 46.5-80.3%) and 45.7% (95% CI: 28.8-63.4%), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.1-7.9 months) and 17.2 months (95% CI: 10.9 - not available, months), respectively. The main grade 3-4 adverse events were increased aspartate aminotransferase (34%), leukopenia (22%), increased alanine aminotransferase (19%), and hypertension (11%). Lenvatinib plus HAIC with cisplatin yielded a favorable ORR and overall survival and was well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC.

        "AbstractText": "The objective of this study was to report the clinicopathologic features of three cases of MYCN-amplified retinoblastoma identified genetically by aqueous humor sampling. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using isolated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from aqueous humor of 3 retinoblastoma patients. We analyzed genomic copy number and mutational alterations, histologic and pathologic features, and clinical data. The most common genetic alteration identified in these three retinoblastoma cases was a focal MYCN amplification on 2p. All tumors showed an early age of diagnosis with a median of 9 months. The tumor histopathologic features included neovascularization and subretinal seeding in case 1, diffuse nature with choroidal and prelaminar optic nerve invasion in case 2, and complete vitreous seeding in case 3. Case 1 expressed RB protein and had no RB1 mutation, case 2 did not express RB protein and had an RB1 mutation, and case 3 did not express RB protein and likely had an epigenetic effect on RB expression. Our report shows 3 cases of unilateral retinoblastomas diagnosed in patients ranging from 4 months to 18 months old. Genomic analysis from AH cfDNA revealed MYCN amplification with intact RB protein staining in case 1 and lack of RB staining in cases 2 and 3. RB1 mutational analysis in the AH confirmed a pathogenic variant in case 2. Clinical pathology showed features requiring aggressive treatment, specifically enucleation. MYCN-amplified retinoblastomas demonstrate unique pathogenesis and aggressive behavior, regardless if MYCN is a primary or secondary driver of disease. Genomic analysis from aqueous humor may be useful when deciding to enucleate as opposed to treating conservatively. Focal MYCN amplification on 2p might be relevant for tumor growth in this subset of the retinoblastoma population in terms of targeted therapeutics.",

We conducted a computerized retrieval to identify RCTs from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov until April 4th, 2023. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. A total of 10 RCTs were involved, with 5,089 unique patients. A binary random-effect model Mantel-Haenszel method was employed to pool data due to the considerable heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidential interval (CI) of ORR and CBR. The secondary outcome measure represented hazard ratio (HR) of PFS and OS and OR of the frequency of any grade/grade \u22653 AEs.

High breast density increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. The number of chest computed tomography (CT) scans performed each year is increasing. Chest CT scans for lung cancer screening in high-risk patients are the standard of care. Important additional findings can be identified on these exams including coronary artery calcifications, thyroid nodules, and breast density. Our previous research has shown that breast density can be reliably graded on chest CT and is comparable to mammographic grading. However, the inter-reader agreement was higher for chest CT. It is important that thoracic radiologists include the grading of breast density in their chest CT reports. According to mammography literature, this information has proven to be helpful for early detection of breast cancer. Federal legislation recommends notifying both providers and patients about breast density on mammography and so it follows that if we see the same information on chest CT, we should report it so that at the very least the clinician can encourage their patient to have a routine mammogram.",

Strain elastography (SRE) was developed to assess the likelihood of malignancy of lesions based on their stiffness. This has been incorporated into the latest edition of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon and atlas. However, no agreed cut-off stiffness values have been established to distinguish benign from malignant lesions making the translation into routine clinical practice difficult. Superb microvascular imaging (SMI) was developed to better evaluate the vascularity within sonographic lesions and assess their likelihood of malignancy. However, there is also no agreed cut-off value for vascular index (VI) to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. MicroPure was developed to better visualize and evaluate calcifications seen on ultrasound. Its effective use in breast screening and evaluating the calcifications detected for likelihood of malignancy have not been established. This article describes the original intended uses of these applications and reviews the studies evaluating them, showing the varying success of the translation of these tools into routine clinical practice.

        "AbstractText": "For patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negeative metastatic breast cancer (HR+HER2- MBC), switching to another cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) or targeted drugs with different mechanism are considerable treatment strategies post-CDK4/6i. However, no clinical data has been reported on which of the two strategies is more effective. In order to explore optimal treatment option post-CDK4/6i, we performed a retrospective comparative cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib-based therapy versus tucidinostat-based therapy after progression on palbociclib. We identified patients with HR+HER2- MBC who had received abemaciclib-based therapy or tucidinostat-based therapy after progression on palbociclib from the database of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer (CSCO BC). Baseline characteristics, efficacy and safety information of treatments were derived from seven research centers' medical records. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (CBR), PFS according to PIK3CA gene type, and safety. Between April 1st 2020 and June 30th 2022, a total of 149 patients were included, of whom 73 patients received abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (ET), and 76 patients received tucidinostat plus ET. The majority of patients had visceral disease (124/149, 83.2%) and \u22653 metastatic organs (76/149, 51.0%), one third (48/149, 32.2%) had previously been treated \u22653 lines of ET at baseline in MBC setting. CBR was 38.4% (28/73) in abemaciclib group and 17.1% (13/76) in tucidinostat group (P=0.004). There was significant difference in PFS between abemaciclib group and tucidinostat group in both the whole population (5.0 vs. 2.0 months; hazard ratio =0.44; 95% CI: 0.31-0.64; P<0.001) and propensity score matched population. PIK3CA mutations occurred in 44.20% of patients who had undergone multigene sequencing. PIK3CA-mutant showed a negative effect on PFS of abemaciclib-based therapy. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event in both groups for any grade and grades 3-4. Common non-hematological toxicity occurred in abemaciclib group was diarrhea (27.4%), and were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (26.3%), nausea (25.0%), vomiting (11.8%) and hypokalemia (13.2%) in tucidinostat group. Our study suggests superiority of abemaciclib-based therapy over tucidinostat-based therapy in patients progressed on palbociclib, which merits further assessment in larger and prospective trials.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiation treatment is the favored alternative for mastectomy in patients with breast cancer. To allow for breast conservation in patients with large invasive tumors and poor response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) or patients with extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (OPBCS) techniques are introduced. OPBCS allows for breast conservation in a selective group of breast cancer patients who initially would have been treated with mastectomy due to the unfavorable tumor-to-breast ratio. With OPBCS, the oncological tumor excision is combined with plastic surgical breast conservation techniques without compromising oncological safety and maintaining aesthetic outcomes by preserving the shape of the breast. OPBCS should however not be applied to all breast cancer patients and the selection of patients who benefit from OPBCS and the timing of OPBCS are best discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Caution is required in patients with higher risk of positive margins [e.g., multifocal breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), larger tumors and DCIS]. In these patients, delayed OPBCS is recommended to facilitate re-excision and maintain excellent breast conserving rates. Despite proven benefits in selected patients, the increase in the adoption of OPBCS is relatively low. This article provides a clinical perspective on OPBCS.",

        "AbstractText": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for predicting prognosis and effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer. The emergence of novel HER2 antibody-drug conjugate has led to a shift from the binary categorization of HER2 status (i.e., negative and positive) to a ternary categorization gradually (i.e., HER2 0, HER2 low expression and HER2 positive). The heterogeneity of HER2 low expression in breast cancer has also recently aroused widespread concern, and the heterogeneity of tumors has led to differences in the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify the HER2 expression status of breast cancer, which can provide a basis for patients to formulate personalized treatment strategies. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and been widely used in the pathological accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. The research results show that AI can significantly improve the consistency and accuracy of HER2 interpreted by pathologists in breast cancer. This has provoked many discussions on HER2-low breast cancer, such as quality control prior to HER2-low expression detection, the latest progress of tumor heterogeneity, and the application of AI. In this paper, we discuss the latest testing guidelines and advances on HER2-low breast cancer, aiming to standardize and improve the pathological testing of HER2-low breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women, accounting for approximately 30% of all new cancer cases. The prognosis of breast cancer heavily depends on the stage of diagnosis, with early detection resulting in higher survival rates. Various risk factors, including family history, alcohol consumption and hormone exposure, contribute to breast cancer development. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of certain receptors, is particularly aggressive and heterogeneous. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), abnormal dilations of small blood vessels in the brain, is contributed by mutated genes like CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 through the perturbed formation of the CCM signaling complex (CSC). The CSC-non-classic membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs)-progesterone (PRG) (CmP)/CSC-mPRs-PRG-classic nuclear progesterone receptors (nPRs) (CmPn) signaling network, which integrates the CSC with mPRs and nPRs, plays a role in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Understanding these pathways can provide insights into potential treatments. This paper focuses on the emerging field of CmPn/CmP signal networks, which involve PRG, its receptors (nPRs and mPRs), and the CSC. These networks play a role in tumorigenesis, particularly in TNBCs. Aims to deliver a thorough examination of the CmP/CmPn pathways concerning TNBCs, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of these pathways, explores their applications and highlights their significance in the context of TNBCs.",

The analysis of long-term safety and overall survival (OS) is presented here. ACE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial comparing tucidinostat 30 mg/twice weekly plus exemestane 25 mg/day versus placebo plus exemestane 25 mg/day in postmenopausal patients with advanced, HR+ breast cancer. The primary endpoint was PFS, and OS was the secondary endpoint. Of the 365 patients enrolled between July 2015, and June 2017, 244 were assigned to tucidinostat plus exemestane (tucidinostat group) and 121 to placebo plus exemestane group (placebo group). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. The median follow-up from randomization to data cut-off (February 25, 2021) of this analysis was 26.5 months (range, 13.9-45.5 months). A total of 231 deaths (63.3%) from 365 patients occurred, including 155 deaths (63.5%) in the tucidinostat group and 76 deaths (62.8%) in the placebo group. The median OS was 30.3 months (95% CI, 26.7-36.7) in the tucidinostat group and 30.3 months (95% CI, 24.8-38.1) in the placebo group. The safety profiles of both tucidinostat and placebo groups remained consistent with those previously reported, and no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. Neutropenia of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 51.6% of the patients in the tucidinostat group and 2.5% of the patients in the placebo group. Adverse events (AEs) that led to treatment discontinuations from any cause occurred in 28 (11.5%) patients in the tucidinostat group and 4 (3.3%) in the placebo group. Although tucidinostat in combination with exemestane had produced a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint PFS, the ACE study did not show a prolongation of the secondary endpoint OS in the tucidinostat combination regimen.

        "AbstractText": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor to invasive breast cancer. However, if left untreated, about 50% of DCIS progress. Preventing such a progression is of paramount importance. Cumulative evidence indicated that the mevalonate cascade, the core of cholesterol biosynthesis, contributes to the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway providing the isoprenoids required for GTPase activation, the nuclear accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) coactivator, and the subsequent gene transcription and that the disruption of this cooperation associated with tumor progression. In this in silico study, we investigated whether such a disruption occurred already during the transformation of the normal mammary epithelium into DCIS. To this aim, we interrogated a publicly available dataset, and we explored the interrelationship of the genes involved in the de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and the association with those coding for the core components of the Hippo signaling pathway in a set of patient-matched samples of DCIS and corresponding histologically normal (HN) epithelium. Most genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were more expressed in DCIS than in the corresponding HN epithelium. This differential expression was associated with a substantial change in their correlation profile. In particular, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR) and INSIG1 lost the positive association shown in the HN epithelium, and their negative association with LSS switched to a positive one. Also, GGPS1, which plays a crucial role in isoprenoids production, significantly changed its correlation profile. The positive association between GGPS1 and HMGCR or INSIG1 disappeared, whereas the positive association with SQLE, which drives the irreversible commitment to cholesterol, switched to a negative one in DCIS. Present findings corroborated the hypothesis that a dysfunctional mevalonate pathway possibly concurs with DCIS development by leading to abnormal production of isoprenoids, which in turn activate GTPases and promote YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation, and suggested the safe and low-cost treatment with statins as the possible winning strategy to contrast this metabolic dysfunction.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The association between perioperative opioids and breast cancer recurrence: a narrative review of the literature.",
        "AbstractText": "Opioid use disorder is an evolving crisis, and 17.2% of postsurgical patients continue to fill an opioid prescription one year after surgery. Preclinical studies suggest perioperative opioid use, defined here as opioids used in the setting of operative pain, may be linked to inferior oncologic outcomes. If this were true, opioid minimization strategies for surgical patients may reduce opioid-related deaths in more than one way. This review aims to describe the association between perioperative opioid use and breast cancer recurrence. On November 1, 2021, we searched the Ovid and EMBASE databases for the terms \"breast neoplasm\", \"opioid analgesics\", \"neoplasm recurrence\", and \"neoplasm metastasis\". Of the 350 articles retrieved, 11 met our inclusion criteria. The review was undertaken using the enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) checklist for quality. Clinical studies report no clear association between perioperative opioid use and local or distant breast cancer recurrence. Mixed results were found when assessing perioperative opioid use and overall survival. Multiple studies paradoxically found opioid use to be associated with lower recurrence rates, despite higher mortality rates. Most studies showed no difference in recurrence or survival in breast cancer surgery patients who did or did not receive opioid-containing analgesia, although most findings were limited by study design and low event rates in patients with breast cancer. The lack of a clear connection between perioperative opioid use and breast cancer recurrence contradicts some preclinical data, which describes mechanisms through which opioids upregulate tumor proliferation which might worsen oncologic outcomes. Existing clinical literature is limited to mostly retrospective studies in patients with predominantly early-stage breast cancers, with low event rates. Given the worsening opioid epidemic and preclinical study findings, opioid minimization strategies should still be explored. Future work should be prospective and examine cancer recurrence in high-risk patients with more advanced tumor pathologies.",

        "AbstractText": "Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors comprising less than 1% of cases, categorized as benign, borderline, or malignant. Treatment typically involves complete surgical excision with wide margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be recommended for borderline or malignant tumors, or when clear margins cannot be achieved through surgery alone. We conducted a retrospective review of 14 women diagnosed with phyllodes tumors between 2015 and 2023. Among them, 36% had benign tumors and 64% had borderline/malignant tumors. The majority (86%) underwent breast-conserving surgery. Postoperative radiation therapy was delivered to the whole breast/chest wall, with a median biologically effective dose (BED) of 92.7 Gy (90.0-102.6 Gy), representing a moderate dose-escalation over conventional breast cancer schedules. After a median follow-up of 48.5 months, no local or distant recurrence were observed. Mild to moderate skin toxicity occurred in all patients: 36% reported grade 1, 43% grade 2, and 21% grade 3 toxicity. One patient developed grade 2 fibrosis during follow-up. No significant correlations were found between the severity of acute/late toxicity and tumor size, surgical approach, or the radiation field's planning target volume (PTV). Adjuvant radiation therapy appears to be well tolerated and feasible for high-risk phyllodes tumors. However, the decision to utilize radiotherapy should be personalized, considering tumor characteristics and the risks and benefits associated with treatment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Features and applications of Ehrlich tumor model in cancer studies: a literature review.",
        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, responsible for a large number of deaths, especially among women. Therapeutic options for breast cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy, but further studies of the pathogenesis of this disease and new treatments are still needed. In vitro and in vivo cancer models are important research tools. Murine Ehrlich tumors are one of these models, especially for hormone-positive breast cancer. The present narrative review discusses characteristics of the Ehrlich tumor model, laboratory manipulations of Ehrlich cells (ECs), and applications in pharmacological, pathological, and translational studies. This review was based on scientific articles, books, and theses on Ehrlich tumors. We searched the PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar, Google, and Clarivate databases. Hormone-positive ECs produce solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC) and ascitic Ehrlich carcinoma (AEC), with different features and applications. The presence of SEC or AEC induces systemic and immunological alterations that are similar to cancer in humans, what makes this model applicable to different studies in the cancer field. Ehrlich tumors are a relevant tool for improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer and investigating the tumor microenvironment, side effects of therapies, and new treatment options. Despite some limitations, such as the absence of an invasive phenotype to produce metastasis, both SEC and AEC are relevant in preclinical and translational studies of breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, the field of breast cancer diagnosis and therapy has witnessed rapid technological advances. Concurrently, the emergence of molecular biology and novel detection methodologies has facilitated the transition of breast cancer management into the precision medicine era. The primary objective of this review is to discuss the transformation in the research and development paradigm for breast cancer therapies and strategies. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for relevant studies published over the past 20 years using keywords including \"breast cancer\", \"clinical trial\", \"seamless\", \"master protocol\", \"umbrella\", \"basket\", \"platform\", and \"precision medicine\". Articles were screened for eligibility and key data extracted. The search was limited to English-language publications. The review identifies three core innovations in breast cancer trial methodology: (I) in terms of research speed, the traditional three-stage drug development models are being substituted by \"seamless designs\" as exemplified by the immunotherapy combination study NCT0328056. (II) Addressing research breadth, \"master protocols\" such as basket trials (IMMU-132-01), umbrella trials (FUTURE), and platform trials (I-SPY 2) have been introduced, allowing the simultaneous assessment of multiple treatments or disease subtypes within a singular framework. (III) Pertaining to research precision, newer designs utilize biomarkers such as \"enrichment\" (seen in EMBRACA and OlympiA trials) and \"marker stratification\" (as in the SOLAR-1 trial), enabling the identification of appropriate patient subgroups and the provision of tailored therapy strategies, a stark contrast to traditional histopathology-based evaluations. Clinical trial design in breast cancer research has been revolutionized, moving towards more efficient and targeted strategies. Despite the presence of ethical, logistical, and data complexities, it is anticipated that ongoing technological and regulatory enhancements will pave the way for even more refined research approaches, subsequently influencing future research, clinical practices, and policymaking in breast cancer care.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is a disease of global concern, regardless of economic status. A significant disparity in breast cancer care between low- and high-income countries is not unexpected, but consideration can be given to particular aspects of therapy to allow as much equitability as possible. One of these aspects involves biopsy of breast lesions. With available resources, management in developed countries focuses on dealing with screening and image-detected lesions. In such circumstances, advanced percutaneous biopsy techniques are utilized liberally. However, where resources are less forthcoming for mammographic screening, women frequently present with symptomatic, palpable and larger tumours. This scenario behooves the clinician to modify treatment approaches and yet use cost-effective management strategies. It is essential that thought is applied to breast biopsy technique used where there is cost-consciousness as it significantly influences subsequent therapy. Less expensive strategies like fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB), when performed with particular attention to technique, handling, transportation and preparation of biopsy specimens allows a high level of accuracy and provides adequate information for the next steps in treatment. This mini-review discusses the variation in biopsy approaches among lower and higher income areas and offers suggestions for appropriate breast biopsy strategies in resource-limited countries.",

This review endeavors to offer a thorough examination of the present state of treatment strategies for early stage triple negative breast cancer (eTNBC), with a particular emphasis on immunotherapy modalities, combination therapies, predictive biomarkers, and ongoing clinical trials. The principal aim of this review is to meticulously assess the available literature, ascertain significant discoveries, and engage in discussions regarding their potential implications for future research endeavors, clinical applications, and policy formulation. This review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, with the latest update performed in March 2023. The search strategy was designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the literature, with a focus on recent advancements. We critically assess the current eTNBC treatment landscape, covering efficacy and limitations of monotherapy, combination therapies, and predictive biomarkers. We highlight promising results from recent trials, address controversies surrounding chemotherapy, and explore optimal approaches for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Insights into personalized treatment strategies, ongoing trials, and future perspectives are provided, advancing our understanding of therapeutic options for eTNBC. Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, this review highlights the potential of immunotherapy, particularly in combination with chemotherapy, as a promising approach for treating eTNBC. However, further research is warranted to optimize treatment strategies, refine patient selection criteria, and identify reliable biomarkers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The findings of this review hold significant implications for future research, clinical practice, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the current challenges and advancements in eTNBC treatment. Ultimately, this knowledge can contribute to improved patient outcomes, enhanced quality of life, and the development of more effective therapeutic approaches for eTNBC.",

        "AbstractText": "The revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) is an important prognostic tool in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL); however, outcomes can vary markedly within R-IPI groups, and additional prognostic markers are needed. We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate the circulating immature myeloid (IM) cell subsets and cytokine profiles of 31 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL before and after chemoimmunotherapy. Among circulating IM cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were the predominant cell type (73.8% \u00b1 26%). At baseline, circulating monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) were predominantly mutually exclusive. Patients with DLBCL clustered into three distinct immunotypes according to MDSC levels and subtype predominance: M-MDSChigh, PMN-MDSChigh, and MDSClow. The M-MDSChigh immunotype was associated with the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype and elevated serum IL-8 and MIP-1\u03b1 levels. PMN-MDSChigh was associated with the non-GCB subtype and elevated IL-8, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1Ra levels. Standard chemoimmunotherapy partially reduced M-MDSC distribution across the MDSClow and M-MDSChigh groups. By contrast, among the MDSClow and PMN-MDSChigh groups, PMN-MDSCs persisted after treatment. Two high-risk patients with non-GCB DLBCL and MDSClow immunotype experienced early disease recurrence within 12 months of treatment completion. This study demonstrates that distinct types of MDSCs are associated with subtypes of DLBCL. MDSC levels are dynamic and may be associated with disease status. Persistence of PMN-MDSCs among high-risk patients with DLBCL may be associated with early relapse.",

This cross-sectional study was used to investigate a potential link between pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of surgical site infections in patients undergoing oral cavity oncology surgery. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary center in northwestern India from May 2022 to May 2023. Patients scheduled to undergo oral cavity oncology surgery during this period were eligible for inclusion. Patients with complete pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and documented post-operative wound infection status were included in the analysis. A total of 85 patients who underwent oral cavity oncology surgery were included in the study. Among them, 30.58% (26 patients) had pre-operative vitamin D deficiency, The overall incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was 36.47% (31 patients). Among the patients with pre-operative vitamin D deficiency, 23 (88.5%) developed surgical site infections. Finally, pre-operative levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, pre-operative poor oral hygiene, and low albumin were confirmed as statistically significant independent predictors of SSI. After doing multivariate analysis, vitamin D deficiency was found to be a significant predictor of post-op wound infection [adjusted odds ratio\u2009-\u20090.71 (95% CI 0.61-0.82); p value\u2009<\u20090.001]. This study highlights the significant association between pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of surgical site infections in patients. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating the immune response, promoting antimicrobial peptides, and enhancing wound healing. These findings support the importance of assessing and addressing vitamin D deficiency in patients scheduled for oral cavity oncology surgery to potentially reduce the incidence of SSIs.",

In India, very little data is available regarding the clinico-epidemiological pattern of urinary bladder cancers. In this study, we analysed the clinico-demographic profile of patients with urinary bladder carcinoma, attending a tertiary care centre in Eastern India over the last 5\u00a0years. We analysed the database of Oncology OPD of a tertiary care centre in West Bengal in Eastern India and collected the demographic, clinical and treatment data of urinary bladder carcinoma patients who attended our OPD between 2017 and 2021. The objective was to assess the demographic and clinical profile of these patients and compare them with those reported from other parts of India as well as the rest of the world. Majority of patients (70%) were above 50\u00a0years of age with a strikingly huge male predominance (male:female\u2009=\u20096.6:1). Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was the most common (90%) histology. 67.2% of the cases were muscle-invasive disease at presentation, and 19.3% of the patients presented with metastatic disease with bone (42%) as the most common site of metastasis. Overall, around 22% of patients underwent surgery either with definitive or palliative intent. Sixty-five percent of the patients who received radiotherapy underwent definitive radiation as a part of bladder preservation protocol. Thirty-five percent of all patients received chemotherapy; most of them (50.5%) received chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment before definitive therapy. To conclude, it can be said that this study is one of its first from Eastern India and will act as a stepping stone for future studies concentrating on clinico-epidemiological profile, early diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma urinary bladder.",

This study aims to systematically review the English literature to recognize the clinicopathologic characteristics of OMSs. An electronic search was performed in PubMed Central and Scopus databases. The search included all the published articles (human case reports and case series) up till April 2023, with no time restrictions. OMSs were slightly more prevalent in males in their fifth to seventh decades of life. However, a high percentage of OMSs has been reported in the second decade of life. Lower extremities, breasts and uterus are the most common primary origin of metastatic sarcoma. Gingiva and mandible were common locations in the oral cavity for metastatic deposits. Generally, they demonstrated widespread affliction. The mean time interval between primary tumor detection and diagnosis of the oral metastasis was about 33.54 \u00b1 36.19 months. Death was reported in 83 patients (67.48 %) with a mean survival rate of 7.98 \u00b1 10.30 months.

These findings were recapitulated in 3D spheroids generated using PDAC cells harboring wild-type versus mutant KRAS.

Taken together, our data show that FeHA is capable of triggering cancer cell death in a KRAS-selective, STEAP3-dependent manner in PDAC cells.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Influence of structural moieties in squaraine dyes on optoacoustic signal shape and intensity.",
        "AbstractText": "Optoacoustic imaging has grown in clinical relevance due to inherent advantages in sensitivity, resolution, and imaging depth, but the development of contrast agents is lacking. This study assesses the influence of structural features of squaraine dyes on optoacoustic activity through computational models, in vitro testing, and in vivo experimentation. The squaraine scaffold was decorated with halogens and side-chain extensions. Extension of side chains and heavy halogenation of squaraines both increased optoacoustic signals individually, although they had a more significant effect in tandem. Density functional theory models suggest that the origin of the increased optoacoustic signal is the increase in transition dipole moment and vibrational entropy, which manifested as increased absorbance in near-infrared region (NIR) wavelengths and decreased fluorescence quantum yield. This study provides insight into the structure-function relationships that will lead guiding principles for optimizing optoacoustic contrast agents. Further developments of squaraines and other agents will further increase the relevance of optoacoustic imaging in a clinical setting.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Exploring the Interplay Between Lifestyle Medicine and Oral Health: A Bidirectional Relationship.",
        "AbstractText": "Lifestyle medicine, characterized by its evidence-based approach, recognizes the profound impact of lifestyle choices on overall health. The six pillars of lifestyle medicine encompass nutrition, physical activity, stress management, sleep, avoidance of risky substances, and social connections. While their significance in promoting general health is well-established, their specific influence on oral health is an area of growing interest. A balanced and nutritious diet contributes to strong teeth and healthy gums, while regular physical activity enhances blood circulation and salivary flow, which is vital for maintaining optimal oral health. Effective stress management techniques can mitigate oral health issues related to anxiety and bruxism. Quality sleep supports oral health, allowing for tissue repair and immune system rejuvenation. Avoiding risky substances like tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption reduces the risk of oral diseases such as periodontitis and oral cancer. Lastly, social connections and supportive networks positively influence oral health by promoting positive oral hygiene behaviors and providing access to dental care resources. Understanding the impact of lifestyle medicine's six pillars on oral health offers valuable insights for healthcare professionals and individuals seeking to improve their oral well-being.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Lung Cancer Prediction Model \"Stress Test\": Assessment of Models' Performance in a High-Risk Prospective Pulmonary Nodule Cohort.",
        "AbstractText": "Pulmonary nodules represent a growing health care burden because of delayed diagnosis of malignant lesions and overtesting for benign processes. Clinical prediction models were developed to inform physician assessment of pretest probability of nodule malignancy but have not been validated in a high-risk cohort of nodules for which biopsy was ultimately performed. Do guideline-recommended prediction models sufficiently discriminate between benign and malignant nodules when applied to cases referred for biopsy by navigational bronchoscopy? We assembled a prospective cohort of 322 indeterminate pulmonary nodules in 282 patients referred to a tertiary medical center for diagnostic navigational bronchoscopy between 2017 and 2019. We calculated the probability of malignancy for each nodule using the Brock model, Mayo Clinic model, and Veterans Affairs (VA) model. On a subset of 168 patients who also had PET-CT scans before biopsy, we also calculated the probability of malignancy using the Herder model. The performance of the models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for each model. The study cohort contained 185 malignant and 137 benign nodules (57% prevalence of malignancy). The malignant and benign cohorts were similar in terms of size, with a median longest diameter for benign and malignant nodules of 15 and 16 mm, respectively. The Brock model, Mayo Clinic model, and VA model showed similar performance in the entire cohort (Brock AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; Mayo Clinic AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; VA AUC, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74). For 168 nodules with available PET-CT scans, the Herder model had an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85). Currently available clinical models provide insufficient discrimination between benign and malignant nodules in the common clinical scenario in which a patient is being referred for biopsy, especially when PET-CT scan information is not available.",

        "AbstractText": "Truncated mucin-type O-glycans, such as Tn-associated antigens, are aberrantly expressed biomarkers of cancer, but remain challenging to target. Reactive antibodies to these antigens either lack high-affinity or are prone to antigen escape. Here, we have developed a robust chemoenzymatic strategy for the global labeling of Tn-associated antigens, i.e. Tn (GalNAc\u03b1-O-Ser/Thr), Thomsen-Friedenreich (Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b1-O-Ser/Thr, TF) and STF (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b1-O-Ser/Thr, STF) antigens, in human whole blood with high efficiency and selectivity. This method relies on the use of the O-glycan sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc1 to transfer a sialic acid-functionalized adaptor to the GalNAc residue of these antigens. By tagging, the adaptor functionalized antigens can be easily targeted by customized strategies such as, but not limited to, chimeric antigen receptor T-Cells (CAR-T). We expect this tagging system to find broad applications in cancer diagnostics and targeting in combination with established strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) are safe and effective saponin-based adjuvants formed by the self-assembly of saponin, cholesterol, and phospholipids in water to form cage-like 30-40 nm diameter particles. Inclusion of the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) in ISCOM particles yields a promising next-generation adjuvant termed Saponin-MPLA NanoParticles (SMNP). In this work, we detail protocols to produce ISCOMs or SMNP via a tangential flow filtration (TFF) process suitable for scalable synthesis and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production of clinical-grade adjuvants. SMNP or ISCOM components were solubilized in micelles of the surfactant MEGA-10, then diluted below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant to drive ISCOM self-assembly. Assembly of ISCOM/SMNP particles using the purified saponin QS-21 used in clinical-grade saponin adjuvants was found to require controlled stepwise dilution of the initial micellar solution, to prevent formation of undesirable kinetically-trapped aggregate species. An optimized protocol gave yields of ~77% based on the initial feed of QS-21 and the final SMNP particle composition mirrored the feed ratios of the components. Further, samples were highly homogeneous with comparable quality to that of material prepared at lab scale by dialysis and purified via size-exclusion chromatography. This protocol may be useful for clinical preparation of ISCOM-based vaccine adjuvants and therapeutics.",

        "AbstractText": "Operating nanofluidic biosensors requires threading single molecules to be analyzed from microfluidic networks into nanostructures, mostly nanochannels or nanopores. Different inlet structures have been employed as a means of enhancing the number of the capture events into nanostructures. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of various engineered inlet structures formed at the micro/nanochannel interface on the capture of single \u03bb-DNA molecules into the nanochannels. Different inlet geometries were evaluated and ranked in order of their effectiveness. Adding an inlet structure prior to a nanochannel effectively improved the DNA capture rate by 190 - 700 % relative to that for the abrupt micro/nanochannel interface. The capture of DNA from the microchannel to various inlets was determined mainly by the capture volumes of the inlet structures and the geometrically modified electric field in the inlet structure. However, as the width of the inlet structure increased, the hydrodynamic flow existing in the microchannel negatively influenced the DNA capture by dragging some DNA molecules deep into the inlet structure back to the microchannel. Our results indicate that engineering inlet structures is an effective means of controlling the capture of DNA molecules into nanostructures, which is important for operation of nanofluidic biosensors.",

We review the literature and describe the presentation, the differential diagnosis and the management of this tumor. Case report We report the case of a 63-year-old patient who was referred for a diplopia with recent hemi-cranial headache. Physical examination showed no exophthalmos nor decrease in visual acuity. The patient complained of diplopia on elevation and oculomotricity examination showed limited elevation of the right eye. The Hess Lancaster test was in favor of a limited course of the right inferior rectus muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a fusiform tissue process in the right inferior rectus muscle with a fatty signal. A complete excision of the tumor was performed by a trasncunjonctival approach. Cytopathological examination was consistent with a pleomorphic lipoma. The postoperative period was uneventful. The definitive histopathologic diagnosis was a lipoma. The postoperative Magnetic resonance imaging showed the complete disappearance of the lesion. With 3 years of follow up, there is no sign of recurrence or ocular motility trouble. Conclusion: Lipomas are rare tumors in the orbit. The clinic is variable depending on the size and the site. The clinical diagnosis is difficult to make. Only histology allows the final diagnosis.",

Our study used LC-MS untargeted metabolomic approaches and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize the molecular changes induced by a specific moderate uniaxial stretch regimen (i.e., 24\u00a0h-1\u00a0Hz, cyclic stretch 0,5% elongation) on SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. Differential metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the mechanical stimulation induces a downregulation of both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. At the same time, the amino acid metabolism was found to be dysregulated, with the mechanical stimulation enhancing glutaminolysis and reducing the methionine cycle. Our findings showed that cell metabolism and oxidative defense are tightly intertwined in mechanically stimulated cells. On the one hand, the mechano-induced disruption of the energy cell metabolism was found correlated with an antioxidant glutathione (GSH) depletion and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, we showed that a moderate stretch regimen could disrupt the cytoprotective gene transcription by altering the expression levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) genes. Interestingly, the cyclic applied strain could induce a cytotoxic sensitization (to the doxorubicin-induced cell death), suggesting that mechanical signals are integral regulators of cell cytoprotection. Hence, focusing on the mechanosensitive system as a therapeutic approach could potentially result in more effective treatments for osteosarcoma in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "The most common cause of infertility and metabolic problems among women of reproductive age is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a multifaceted disorder. It is an endocrine disorder that occurs in approximately one in seven women. Among these PCOS patients, two thirds will not ovulate on a regular basis and seek treatment for ovulation induction. The symptoms vary in their severity, namely ovulation disorders, excessive androgen levels, or polycystic ovarian morphology. All these symptoms require a therapeutic approach. Many drugs are used to eradicate PCOS symptoms, like metformin, clomiphene citrate, spironolactone, and pioglitazone. Long-term treatment is required to achieve the desired outcome, which is often accompanied by significant adverse reactions. Some herbs and phytochemicals are equally effective for treating PCOS and produce minimal side effects. Recently, herbal products are gaining popularity due to their wide biological activities, safety, availability, and efficacy. The present review covers aetiology, current treatment, pathophysiology, and detailed pre-clinical and clinical studies on plants and phytochemicals that are proven to be useful for the treatment of symptoms associated with PCOS.",

        "AbstractText": "Tracheal intubation is a common technique used to secure a patient's airway, which is crucial in anesthesia. Successful tracheal intubation depends on various factors, including the assessment of the patient's airway before the procedure. In recent years, scoring systems, such as LEMON (an acronym for the assessment of the airway's appearance, identification of any dental issues, evaluation of Mallampati classification, assessment of airway obstruction, and examination of neck mobility) and intubation difficulty scale (IDS) have gained attention. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the LEMON criteria and IDS in tracheal intubation. The goal was to provide valuable insights that can assist medical professionals in optimizing their approach to airway management by analyzing clinical data, assessing patient outcomes, and evaluating the consistency between these scoring systems. This study was based on a descriptive-analytical study involving a group of patients requiring intubation. This study examined 105 patients scheduled for elective surgeries, aged between 19 and 60 years, without specific underlying diseases, such as laryngeal cancer, temporomandibular joint stiffness, or significant tongue enlargement, and with a body mass index (BMI) below 40 kg/m\u00b2. Initially, expert anesthesiologists assessed the patients using the LEMON criteria, and then the degree of intubation difficulty was measured using the IDS scoring system. Finally, these two criteria were compared. In this study, there was a significant correlation between the LEMON score and the IDS score (P < 0.001). The difficult intubation group (IDS score higher than 0) had higher LEMON scores (with the highest score equal to 4) than the non-difficult intubation group (IDS score of 0) (P = 0.017). The average LEMON and IDS scores were 3.11 and 1.35, respectively. Among the participants, 96.2% had an intubation difficulty score of \u2264 5; nevertheless, 3.8% had a score of > 5. Additionally, limited neck mobility emerged as the sole independent predictor of intubation difficulty (P = 0.002, odds ratio = 6.152). The LEMON score is associated with difficult intubation in adult patients requiring intubation.",

Two separate translators first translated the original questionnaire into the three regional languages, following which a reconciled forward translation was compiled. This reconciled version in each language was then back-translated into English by two other translators. This back-translated version was then compared with the original the EORTC questionnaire for correctness, and the preliminary questionnaires were formed in all three languages. The EORTC translation unit approved the questionnaires. The preliminary questionnaires were administered to 30 patients (10 for each language) diagnosed with rectal or anal canal cancer who had received pelvic radiotherapy and were at risk of developing PRT. None of the patients had seen the questionnaire before. After filling out the questionnaire, each patient was interviewed for difficulty in answering, confusion, understanding, or if any of the questions were upsetting and if patients would have asked the question differently. No changes were suggested for Marathi and Bangla translations. Two modifications were suggested in the Hindi translation, which was then retested in five patients and finalized. All the suggestions were incorporated into the preliminary questionnaires, which were sent back to the EORTC for final approval. After reviewing the entire report of pilot testing for the translated quality-of-life questionaire-PRT-20 in three languages, it was approved by the EORTC translation unit.

However, the impact of these changes on the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain. Therefore, we determined the temporal trends in the etiologies of HCC in Egypt over a decade. We retrospectively analyzed data from consecutive patients who were diagnosed with HCC over 10 years (2010-2020) in a large center in Upper Egypt. Standard tests were utilized to diagnose hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus. In the absence of other liver disorders, the presence of obesity, or diabetes in the absence of other risk factors, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was diagnosed. A total of 1,368 HCC patients were included, in which 985 (72%) had HCV, 58 (4%) had hepatitis B virus, and 143 (10.5%) had MAFLD, 1 patient had hemochromatosis, 1 had autoimmune liver disease, and 180 (13%) patients were with unknown cause. The annual proportions of MAFLD-related HCC were increased significantly between 8.3% in 2010 and 20.6% in 2020 ( p \u2009=\u20090.001), while HCV-related HCC declined from 84.8 to 66.7% ( p \u2009=\u20090.001). Throughout the study period, there were significant increases in the age at diagnosis of HCC, the proportion of female patients, obesity, diabetes, and less severe liver dysfunction at diagnosis ( p \u2009<\u20090.05 for all). With the decline of HCV, MAFLD is becoming a major cause of HCC in Egypt, which has increased substantially over the past 10 years.

There are no reports that depict the differences in outcomes in cancer patients between the two waves of the pandemic. This is a real-world experience aimed at characterizing the differences in demographics, clinical features, treatment details, and outcomes in COVID-19-positive cancer patients between the two pandemic waves. This was a prospective study of all COVID-19-positive cancer patients attending our specialty out-patient department at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre between March 2020 and November 2020 (1st wave) and April 2021 and June 2021 (second wave). All patients diagnosed to have COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a biopsy-proven solid organ malignancy attending the medical oncology out-patient department were included during both the waves. A total of 300 patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection by either RT-PCR or cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test were encountered, of which 123 were encountered during the first wave of the pandemic and 177 during the second wave. The case fatality rate of the first wave was 9.8%, with a 15-day case fatality rate of 5.6%, whereas for the second wave, it was 13% and 7.2%, respectively. Twelve patients succumbed to COVID-19 disease in the first wave and 23 succumbed in the second. There were no statistically significant correlations; however, the death in the second wave tended to occur more in younger male patients, with comorbidities and history of smoking. There was no relation with ongoing cancer-directed treatment or chemotherapy. Our study is unique in comparing characteristics of the two most important COVID-19 waves and treatment patterns in cancer patients from a single center. The second wave showed a higher CFR, hospital admission rate, and higher frequency of respiratory complications; however, there was no relation to cancer-directed therapy and COVID-19, thus reiterating the fact that cancer treatment should not be halted in the event of a COVID-19 infection.",

The study was planned as a randomized, double-blind trial. In part A, a total of 117 mCRC patients were intended to receive 5\u2009mg/kg of bevacizumab every 2 weeks along with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy for a maximum of 18 cycles. In part B, 60 NSCLC patients were to receive 15\u2009mg/kg of bevacizumab every 3 weeks along with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the initial four cycles, followed by pemetrexed for another four cycles. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in both subparts. The anticipated sample size was 106 evaluable mCRC patients to achieve 85% statistical power for concluding noninferiority with a margin of half the difference (18.8%) between DRL_BZ and Avastin, along with a pilot study involving 60 evaluable NSCLC patients. Safety comparison included assessing adverse events (AEs), infusion reactions, and lab abnormalities. Immunogenicity comparison involved the incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Pharmacokinetic comparison was planned after the first and fourth dosing cycles of treatment in 24 NSCLC patients. The PFS6 for mCRC patients treated with DRL_BZ and RMP was 57.8% and 50% respectively, with a difference in efficacy of 7.8 (-8.7, 23.7). The PFS9 was 31.1% and 22.9%, with a difference of 8.2% (-6.9%, 22.9%). The objective response rate (ORR) for DRL_BZ and RMP was 28.8% and 22.4%, while the disease control rate (DCR) was 44.2% and 37.9% respectively. For NSCLC patients, the PFS6 was 44% and 45%, showing a difference of -1.0 (-4.2, 22.1). The ORR was 41.4% and 48.1%, and the DCR was 62.1% and 63%. The frequency, type, and severity of AEs were similar in both indications. Blood levels during the first and fourth dosing cycles exhibited comparable values. All NSCLC patients tested negative for ADA, while no mCRC patients on DRL_BZ tested positive for ADA. Low incidences of ADA (8%) and NAbs (4.0%) were reported in patients on RMP. Overall, the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic parameters of DRL_BZ and RMP were found to be comparable. Clinical Trial Registration For BZ-01-002: CTRI/2016/01/006481.",

Magnetic resonance mammography (MRM) is a valuable complement to conventional methods for the early diagnosis of disease, thereby providing patients with a better prognosis. The number of unnecessary biopsies and repeated excisions in cases of indeterminate breast lesions detected on conventional imaging is high. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of MRM in the evaluation of indeterminate breast lesions [Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 3/4] found in conventional mammography and ultrasonography (USG), taking the histopathological examination (HPE) as the gold standard. Materials and methods: A total of 38 patients with conventional radiological imaging diagnosis of indeterminate breast lesions (BIRADS 3/4) were included in this study and evaluated using contrast-enhanced MRM according to the MR-BIRADS lexicon (5th edition). Morphological characteristics of lesions were evaluated to determine the probability of malignancy. Histopathology was kept as the gold standard for comparing all the statistical parameters. Results: There were a total of 40 lesions, 35 masses, and five nonmass enhancement (NME) available for evaluation out of the 38 patients. The sensitivity of margins to detect malignancy approached 100%; however, it had a slightly lower specificity of 66.67%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed good diagnostic performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 85, 90, 89.47, 85.71, and 87.50%, respectively. Conclusion: The MRI has been shown to be useful as a problem-solving tool in breast cancer screening, clarifying indeterminate findings and avoiding unnecessary short follow-ups and percutaneous biopsies.

        "AbstractText": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a growing global health concern that can lead to liver disease and cancer. It is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver, unrelated to excessive alcohol consumption. Studies indicate that the gut microbiota-host crosstalk may play a causal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, with epigenetic modification serving as a key mechanism for regulating this interaction. In this review, we explore how the interplay between gut microbiota and the host epigenome impacts the development of NAFLD. Specifically, we discuss how gut microbiota-derived factors, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate the DNA methylation and histone acetylation of genes associated with NAFLD, subsequently affecting lipid metabolism and immune homeostasis. Although the current literature suggests a link between gut microbiota and NAFLD development, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying this crosstalk remains limited. Therefore, more comprehensive epigenomic and multi-omic studies, including broader clinical and animal experiments, are needed to further explore the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to NAFLD-associated genes. These studies are anticipated to improve microbial markers based on epigenetic strategies and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD, ultimately addressing a significant unmet clinical need.",

APOBEC1 (A1) catalyzes the conversion of C-to-U in RNA, which is important in regulating cholesterol metabolism through its editing activity on ApoB mRNA. However, A1 requires a cofactor to form an \"editosome\" for RNA editing activity. A1CF and RBM47, both RNA-binding proteins, have been identified as cofactors that pair with A1 to form editosomes and edit ApoB mRNA and other cellular RNAs. SYNCRIP is another RNA-binding protein that has been reported as a potential regulator of A1, although it is not directly involved in A1 RNA editing activity. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel cofactor, RBM46 (RNA-Binding-Motif-protein-46), that can facilitate A1 to perform C-to-U editing on ApoB mRNA. Additionally, using the low-error circular RNA sequencing technique, we identified novel cellular RNA targets for the A1/RBM46 editosome.

Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, and cox-regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors. There were 258 patients [median age was 37 (18-75) years; [males:160 (62%); stage I: 41%; B symptoms: 17 (6%); bulky disease:19 (15%)] treated between 2000 and 2020 who were evaluable.

        "AbstractText": "Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in de-novo acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving induction chemotherapy. Despite using posaconazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal, for IFI prophylaxis, the breakthrough IFI rate is high in the real-world setting. One of the reasons could be frequent suboptimal plasma posaconazole levels. In the present study, we evaluated if therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guided posaconazole prophylaxis can reduce the IFI rates in comparison to a historical cohort. We enrolled 90 patients,\u2009>\u2009/\u2009=\u200916\u00a0years of age, without baseline IFIs, planned for remission induction therapy. All patients were started on posaconazole suspension 200\u00a0mg TDS and the dose was increased in a stepwise manner if trough levels were found to be suboptimal (<\u2009350\u00a0ng/ml for day 2 or\u2009<\u2009700\u00a0ng/ml subsequently). The TDM based approach resulted in a significant decline in breakthrough IFI rates (18% versus 52%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) A total of 69 patients (78%) required dose escalation. Thirty-one patients required change in antifungals due to either suboptimal levels, persistent fever, diarrhoea or vomiting. We could not demonstrate an exposure-response relationship but the difference in IFI rates in patients with a median posaconazole level\u2009>\u2009/\u2009=\u2009700\u00a0ng/ml (0%) and\u2009<\u2009700\u00a0ng/ml (21.6%) was clinically meaningful. Posaconazole levels were found to be significantly lower in patients on antacids and prokinetics. The incidence of posaconazole-related grade 3 toxicity was low (2.3%). Thus TDM-based dosing of posaconazole helps reduce breakthrough IFI rate and should be a part of posaconazole prophylaxis.

        "AbstractText": "Current guidelines recommend computed tomography (cCT) scans of the chest in children with leukemia following 96\u00a0h of the onset of idiopathic neutropenia to eliminate pulmonary invasive fungal infections (IFIs). However, cCT exposes some children who are at a very high risk of developing secondary cancers to radiation. We aimed to determine the effect of antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) with voriconazole (VCZ) on the need for cCT scans in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to eliminate pulmonary IFIs during chemotherapy. We retrospectively screened all patients' data from their electronic charts. Children who were diagnosed as having ALL before February 2013 and did (AFP group) or did not (NoP group) receive AFP were divided into two groups and compared regarding cCT scans and relapse-mortality rates. Ninety-six children were diagnosed before February 2013 and did not receive primary AFP and 146 children were administered VCZ following a diagnosis of ALL. There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. A total of 128 cCTs had been required in 62 children in the NoP group, compared with 64 cCTs in 52 children in the AFP group. The percentage of the patients who had required at least one chest CT scan and the mean number of cCT scans in the NoP group were significantly higher compared with the AFP group. Proven-probable IFIs and relapse-mortality rates were higher in the NoP group compared with the AFP group. Mold-active AFP revealed a significant decrease in the need for cCT scans in children with ALL.",

        "AbstractText": "Growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) correlates with worse outcome of many tumours and any cause mortality. Data about its role in lymphoproliferative neoplasms (LPN) are scarce. Our research aimed to reveal the correlation between GDF-15 and standard laboratory parameters of LPN activity, and to get insight into the possible value of this cytokine assessment in lymphoma patients. Prospective research included 40 patients treated for aggressive or indolent LPN, and 31 with indolent LPN on \"watch and wait\" regimen. Analyses were performed before and after treatment in treated patients and on two separate occasions in the \"watch and wait\" group. ELISA technique with R&D assays according to the manufacturer manual, from stored sera at\u2009-\u200970\u00a0\u00b0C was used for GDF-15 level measurement. Statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 22 using descriptive and inferential statistics. As appropriate, differences between groups were assessed by two tailed t-test, Mann-Whitney or x2 test. Spearman Rank Order Correlation was done to correlate GDF-15 with standard laboratory markers of disease activity. All tests are two-tailed with significance level p < 0. 05. GDF-15 (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and fibrinogen (p\u2009=\u20090.001) concentrations increased after treatment in indolent lymphoma patients while \u03b22 microglobulin decreased (p < 0.001). GDF-15 positively correlated with \u03b22microglobulin before (p < 0.001) and after (p\u2009=\u20090.031) therapy. There were no differences in any of the aforementioned parameters in the \"watch and wait\" group during observation. A positive correlation between GDF-15 and \u03b22 microglobulin in patients with indolent LPN who need treatment suggests potential value in risk assessment.

        "AbstractText": "Leukemia-associated structural chromosomal abnormalities (SCA) can be identified either by karyotyping or interphase-fluorescence in-situ hybridization (i-FISH) assays. Both karyotyping and i-FISH on mononuclear cell suspension are time, resource, and manpower-consuming assays. In this study, we have compared the results of specific leukemia-associated SCAs identified by i-FISH on air-dried bone marrow (BM)/peripheral blood (PB) smears and BM karyotyping. The study was conducted among pediatric patients (age\u2009\u2264\u200918 years) diagnosed with acute leukemias between January 2018 to December 2022. The results of i-FISH on air-dried BM/PB smears and BM-karyotyping for our SCA of interest (BCR::ABL1, ETV6::RUNX1, TCF3::PBX1, KMT2A rearrangement, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, CBFB::MYH11, and PML::RARA) were entered in a contingency table and the agreement of results was calculated. The strength of agreement was assessed by Cramer's V test. Among 270 patients, SCA of interest was identified among 26% and 17% of patients by i-FISH on air-dried smears and karyotyping, respectively. Excluding 53 patients with metaphase failure, the remaining 217 patients had 92% agreement (Cramer's V of 0.931 with p\u2009<\u20090.000) between the results for specific SCAs identified by both techniques. On excluding samples with cryptic cytogenetic aberrancies, there was 99% agreement (Cramer's V of 0.953 with p\u2009<\u20090.000) for gross SCA identified by both techniques. In addition, i-FISH on air-dried smears identified SCA in 30% of patients with metaphase failure. I-FISH on air-dried PB/BMA smears is a less-labor and\u00a0 resource-consuming assay. It can be considered an efficient alternative to conventional karyotyping for\u00a0 identifying specific SCA of interest in under-resourced laboratories.

Single-cell data analysis and cancer cell prediction were conducted using Seurat and CopyKAT package, respectively. Intercellular interactions were explored using CellPhoneDB and CellChat and subsequently validated using co-culture assays, ELISA and histological staining. We performed pathway activity analysis using gene set variation analysis and the Seurat package. The extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling was assessed using a gel contraction assay, atomic force microscopy, and Sirius red staining. The deconvolution of the spatial transcriptomics data using the \"CARD\" package based on single-cell data. We successfully established the HCC-SDS mouse model. Twenty-nine clusters were identified. The interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were significantly enhanced via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling in HCC-SDS. CAFs recruited in HCC-SDS lead to ECM remodeling and the activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Deconvolution of the spatial transcriptome data revealed that CAFs physically surround cancer cells in HCC-SDS. This study reveals that the crosstalk of CAFs-cancer cells is crucial for the tumor-promoting effect of SDS. CAFs recruited by HCC via PDGFA may lead to ECM remodeling through activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, thereby forming a physical barrier to block immune cell infiltration under SDS.",

Hysteroscopy is a safe, simple, well tolerated and reliable procedure for the diagnosis of AUB across all age groups. The aim of the study is to determine the association of hysteroscopy and histopathologic examination (HPE) findings in abnormal uterine bleeding. The secondary objective of the study are to enumerate the hysteroscopy findings in patients with AUB and to evaluate the pattern of AUB. Observational cross-sectional study among 60 women in reproductive and post-menopausal age group presenting with features/symptoms suggestive of abnormal uterine bleeding were studied. All patients reporting in the outpatient department (OPD) and who are eligible to participate were included in the study, after obtaining written informed consent. Detailed history, Clinical examination, Ultrasound pelvis and endometrial thickness assessment is done. Hysteroscopic findings were compared against histopathological findings. The various patterns of bleeding documented in our study population were menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, polymenorrhea, and post-menopausal bleeding. Out of these patterns, the commonest was menorrhagia at 50.0% and post-menopausal bleeding at 26.67%. In our study population, the various hysteroscopy findings were strawberry, tongue-shaped projections, pebble stones, polypoidal patterns, and cerebroid patterns. Out of these, the most common was a polypoidal pattern, strawberry pattern, and tongue-shaped projections with 45%, 31.67%, and 26.7%, respectively. The most common histopathology finding was secretory and proliferative constituting 35% and 26.67%, respectively. Carcinoma endometrium constitutes about 6.67% of the study population. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of strawberry appearance in hysteroscopy in comparison with secretory changes in histopathology were 52.38%, 79.49%, 57.89%, and 75.61%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of tongue-shaped projections appearance in hysteroscopy in comparison with HPE findings was 60%, 76.36%, 18.75%, and 95.45%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of polypoidal pattern in hysteroscopy in comparison with Endometrial hyperplasia in histopathology was 66.67%, 56.14%, 7.41%, and 96.97%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of cerebroid appearance in hysteroscopy in comparison with carcinoma endometrium in histopathology were 75.0%, 100%, 100%, and 98.25%, respectively. This correlation of cerebroid pattern with carcinoma endometrium was highly significant. Among all correlations, the highly reliable was in Carcinoma endometrium followed by endometrial polyps. Hysteroscopy has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing intrauterine pathology especially endometrial cancer followed by endometrial polyps. Among the various patterns of abnormal uterine bleeding, menorrhagia was the most common. A combination of hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling was found to increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding and will effectively guide us in planning the appropriate management for these patients.",

People with AIS condition are genetically male, with XY karyotype in each cell, but their bodies are unable to respond to male sex hormones (called androgens). It is associated with infertility as well as developing cancerous conditions. The genetic association of CAIS involves polymorphism of genes such as NR5A1, SOX9, SRD5A2, CBX2, GATA4, and SRY. Their mutation and participation in genetics of CAIS can be studied by Single Nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis which is a way to detect genetic variations. SNP in coding region leads to synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Hence, this study highlights analysis of SNPs associated with CAIS. Our aim is to study SNP analysis of NR5A1, SOX9, SRD5A2, CBX2, GATA4, SRY genes in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. SIFT and Polyphen analysis was performed for all the genes and samples were subjected for PCR-SSCP technique. SNPs were analyzed for the genes associated with CAIS. Benign and damaging SNPs were identified. DNA Samples were amplified using PCR technique and they will be analyzed using Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). As SNPs have decreased stability, damaging and benign character, they can be used as candidate hallmarks in study of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.",

The frequencies of postoperative complications, anastomotic bleeding, and intraperitoneal abscess were significantly lower, the operative time was significantly shorter, the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter, and the number of dissected lymph nodes was higher in the Q group. No significant differences were observed in disease-free survival, local recurrence, or overall survival rate rates between the groups.

This study retrospectively reviewed data from the National Cancer Center Hospital in Japan between 2000 and 2012. We selected cases that met the following criteria: (1) D2 or more total gastrectomy with splenectomy, (2) UGC-GC, and (3) histological type is gastric adenocarcinoma. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses concerning lymph node stations associated with #10 metastasis. A total of 366 patients were examined.

In this study, we introduce a novel concept of oligometastasis in post-surgical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with hepatic recurrence, which we call \"oligo-like liver metastasis (OLLM).\" Patients with OLLM have better post-recurrence prognosis and could therefore be eligible for surgical intervention. A total of 121 PDAC patients who underwent radical resection, and who had an initial and single-organ metastasis to the liver, were analyzed. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival after recurrence (OSAR) were examined, and patients with all of these factors were defined as OLLM. The clinicopathological features and post-recurrent prognosis of OLLM patients were evaluated. In addition, a detailed analysis using the oligo-score, which was based on the prognostic factors, was performed. The prognostic analysis revealed that short recurrence-free interval (RFI) (<6\u2009months), short stable disease interval (SDI) (\u22643\u2009months), and four or more recurrent tumors were independent poor prognostic factors. OLLM patients were defined as those with all three conditions: long RFI (\u22656\u2009months), long SDI (>3\u2009months), and three or less recurrent tumors. OLLM patients had a significantly better prognosis for OSAR than non-OLLM patients (HR\u2009=\u20090.272, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "AbstractText": "Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is among the most popular targets in nuclear medicine imaging and cancer theranostics. Several small-molecule moieties (FAPI-04, FAPI-46, etc.) are used for developing FAP-targeted theranostic agents. Nonetheless, the circulation time of FAP inhibitors is relatively short, resulting in rapid clearance via kidneys, low tumor uptake, and associated unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. To address the existing drawbacks, we engineered 3 peptides named FD1, FD2, and FD3 with different circulation times through solid-phase peptide synthesis. All the 3 reported peptides bind to human and murine FAP with single-digit nanomolar affinity measured by surface plasmon resonance. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the agents labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu was assessed in several tumor models exhibiting different levels of FAP expression. While radiolabeled FD1 was rapidly excreted from kidneys, radiolabeled FD2/FD3 have significantly prolonged circulation, increased tumor uptake, and decreased kidney accumulation. Our findings indicated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 positron emission tomography (PET) effectively detected FAP dynamics, whereas [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy in FAP-overexpressing tumor models, including pancreatic cancer cell models characterized by abundant stroma. Moreover, a pilot translational investigation demonstrated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 had the capability to identify both primary and metastatic tumors with precision and distinction. In summary, we developed [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 for same-day PET imaging of FAP dynamics and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 for effective radioligand therapy of FAP-overexpressing tumors.",

It typically manifests as a single yellowish plaque across the head and neck and is composed of sebaceous glands. It commonly occurs during infancy and grows during puberty. Usually, it follows a benign course; however, in a few cases, it can be malignant. This is the case of a 13-year-old child with verrucous plaques on the temple and scalp. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with a steadily developing hyperpigmented verrucous plaque on the scalp and ipsilateral side of his face. A dermoscopic examination revealed ridges and fissures in a cerebriform pattern with yellowish-gray globules and a papillary appearance. Physical examination and laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities. Biopsies were taken from the scalp and temple area, and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of nevus sebaceous. The patient was referred to a plastic surgeon for a staged excision. We describe a unique example of a sebaceous nevus that affected the scalp and ipsilateral side of the face. As this hamartomatous growth carries the risk of cancer development, a dermatologist must identify the condition and begin treatment before malignant transformation occurs.

The goal of this study was to provide clinicians with a reliable and beneficial source to understand gastric metastases arising from various primary tumors and to present the growing literature in an easily accessible form. Methods: Articles published in English language from implementation of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases until May 2022 were considered for the systematic review. Articles other than English language, letters to the editor, posters, and clinical images were excluded. Hematogenous and lymphogenic metastases were included whereas direct tumoral invasion and seeding were excluded. Articles and abstracts were analyzed and last selection was done after cross-referencing and by use of defined eligibility criteria. Results: In total 1,521 publications were identified and 170 articles were finally included totaling 186 patients with GM. The median age of patients was 62 years. Gynecologic cancer was the most common cancer type causing GM (67 patients), followed by lung cancer (33 patients), renal cancer (20 patients), and melanoma (19 patients). One of the main treatment methods performed for metastasis was resection surgery (n=62), sometimes combined with chemotherapy (ChT) or immunotherapy. ChT was the other most used treatment method (n=78). Also, immunotherapy was amongst the most preferred treatment options after surgery and ChT (n=10). Conclusions: As 172 case reports were screened in the systematic review from different journals, heterogeneity was inevitable. Some articles missed important information such as complete follow-up or clinical information. Moreover, since all of the included articles were case reports quality assessment could not be performed. Among 172 case reports reviewed, resection surgery was performed the most and was sometimes combined with ChT and immunotherapy. Further research about what type of treatment has the best outcomes for patients with gastric metastases is needed.",

It affects any age-group and has a plethora of clinical presentations, the most common being the neuropsychiatric manifestation. The diagnosis of this entity at the right time and proper treatment with immunotherapy can save many lives. In this study, we describe the demographic profile, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and treatment of 42 patients with features of AIE. This is a prospective study where 42 cases were selected from a tertiary care center in Northwestern India. Patients with suspected AIE underwent detailed clinical assessment, routine blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study, and autoimmune profile in blood and CSF. Screening for malignancy was done in all patients with computer tomography (CT) thorax and abdomen and tumor markers. Among 42 patients, males, and females were almost equally affected. The mean age of onset was 31 years. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) Encephalitis was the commonest of all AIE (57%) followed by anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated-1 (anti-LGI-1) related AIE (11.9%), anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (anti-CASPR2) related AIE (4.7%), and steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) related to antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody (2.3%). Neuropsychiatric manifestation is the commonest. The seizure was noted in around 72% of patients, the commonest in the anti-NMDAR group. Faciobrachial dystonic seizure (FBDS) was noted in all five anti-LG1-1 encephalitis patients. CSF abnormalities were seen in 33.3% of patients in the form of pleocytosis or raised protein, or both. MRI abnormality was seen in 52% of patients. EEG was abnormal in 10% of patients, and delta brush was noted in three anti-NMDAR patients. All patients received immunotherapy in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or pulse IV methylprednisolone (IVMPS), or both. Two patients nonresponsive to IVIg and IVMPS received rituximab. Almost all patients responded to immunotherapy. Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE), a potentially treatable immune-responsive entity, is a common neurological problem and may be an answer to a large number of cases having unexplained encephalitis.

        "AbstractText": "Dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN), a potent hepatotoxin, exerts carcinogenic effects and induces hepatic necrosis in experimental animals via CYP2E1 metabolic activation, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Protocatechuic acid (PCA), a plant-based simple phenolic compound and potent antioxidant, has been shown to affect the development of neoplasia in the rat liver and inhibit the initiation or progression phases of most cancers. In this study, the modulatory effects of PCA on DMN-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and selected phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes were investigated in male Wistar rats. This study assessed biomarkers of hepatic injury (alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma- glutamyl transferase); oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide concentration, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione levels); measured activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, sodium dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase); and inflammation (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin-1-Beta (IL-1\u03b2) and iNOS). The results of our investigation demonstrated that pretreatment with PCA at 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight p.o. reduced DMN (20 mg/kg bw) i.p. mediated hepatic injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activities of phase I metabolizing enzymes were significantly induced except for aminopyrine-N-demethylase in the DMN-treated rats when compared with the DMN alone control group. This induction was also reversed by pre-treatment with PCA. The result of this study suggests that PCA is hepatoprotective against DMN-induced hepatic damage by its ability to suppress oxidative stress, inflammation, and modulate the activities of the selected phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Thus, PCA may prove useful in combating DMN-induced hepatic damage.",

Twenty-one radiologists (12 countries) staged 75 rectal cancers on MRI using a structured reporting template.

Agreement with an expert consensus served as a surrogate standard of reference to estimate diagnostic accuracy. Polychoric correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations between diagnostic confidence and accuracy (=agreement with expert consensus). Uniformity to diagnose high-risk (\u2265cT3\u2009ab) versus low-risk (\u2264cT3\u2009cd) cT-stage, cN0 versus cN+, lateral nodes and tumour deposits, MRF and sphincter involvement, and solid versus mucinous tumours was high with IOA > 80% in the majority of cases (and >80% agreement with expert consensus). Results for assessing extramural vascular invasion, cT-stage (cT1-2/cT3/cT4a/cT4b), cN-stage (cN0/N1/N2), relation to the peritoneal reflection, extent of sphincter involvement (internal/intersphincteric/external) and morphology (solid/annular/semi-annular) were considerably poorer.

There are only approximately 200 cases reported in the English literature to date. Histologically, it may be mistaken for spindle cell neoplasms such as gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Patients with AIHPS usually present with early satiety, abdominal fullness, postprandial vomiting, epigastric pain, and eructations. Adult intussusception is rare and only accounts for 5% of all intussusceptions. Gastroduodenal intussusception is one of the rare types of adult intussusception. This is more likely to occur when a benign or malignant stomach lesion acts as a lead point. We report a case of AIHPS in a 70-year-old lady presenting with gastroduodenal intussusception. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) was performed, and it revealed a diffusely thickened and narrowed pyloric antrum. A contrasted computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax and abdomen showed a distended stomach with circumferential thickening of the pylorus. The pre-pyloric antrum was intussuscepting into the pylorus, and the apex is seen within the first part of duodenum. She underwent distal gastrectomy with a Roux-en-y reconstruction via laparoscopic approach and was discharged well. AIHPS is a rare condition and should be a differential in adults presenting with gastric outlet obstruction. We believe in cases of AIHPS presenting with gastroduodenal intussusception, a distal gastrectomy with reconstruction is a reasonable approach. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to obtain the best outcome.",

The axillary maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) values of the patients in the preoperative period, the features in the perioperative and postoperative specimen and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram data were evaluated. As axillary SUVmax detected by Positron emission tomography in the preoperative period increased, so did the likelihood of lymph node involvement.

Age, lymph node number, histopathology results, mass diameter, presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion and/or perineural invasion, tumor type, estrogen receptor status, Ki67 and Cerb-B2 statuses were not correlated.

        "AbstractText": "Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a skill-oriented training programme required to be practised and updated periodically by every healthcare provider. Methods In an open-label randomized controlled trial, 81 fourth-year BSc Nursing students were randomized to experimental (n=41) and control (n=40) groups using a computer-generated table. The learning resource material was shared through a mobile-app with the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG) received the internet link for retrieving the learning resource material, 4 days before a 1-day training programme. Baseline knowledge and skills assessment of the students was done before the commencement of the training programme, using a pre-validated self-developed questionnaire based on standardized CPR guidelines of professional bodies. Post-intervention assessment of knowledge, skills, confidence and satisfaction of the students with the training methodology was done at the end of the training programme. The confidence and satisfaction of the students with the training methodology were assessed using a standardized confidence scale and a self-developed satisfaction scale, respectively. Results The baseline knowledge and skills scores of the students were comparable (EG v. CG, knowledge: 16.04 [2.35] v. 15.52 [2.69], p=0.34; skill: 13.41 [5.28] v. 15.02 [4.66], p=0.16). A comparable improvement was seen in post-intervention knowledge and skills scores between the groups (EG v. CG, knowledge 17.78 [1.49] v. 17.70 [1.51], p=0.82; skill 29.85 [2.44] v. 30.08 [2.79], p=0.60). The post-intervention confidence in performing the skills (20.22 [2.76] v. 19.41 [3.63], p=0.331) and satisfaction with the method of dissemination of educational resource material (29.85 [2.4] v. 30.08 [2.79], p=0.73) were also comparable in both the groups. Conclusion Both mobile app-based and internet link-based learning resource material along with hands-on sessions were effective in bringing comparable improvement in knowledge, skills, self-confidence and satisfaction of students in performing the selected skills of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

        "AbstractText": "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend definitive chemoradiation rather than surgery for patients with locally advanced clinical stage T3 and N2 (stage IIIB) lung cancer involving the chest wall. The data supporting this recommendation are controversial. We studied whether surgery confers a survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation in the National Cancer Database. We identified all patients with clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer in the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2017 who underwent a lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection and compared them with patients with clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer who had definitive chemoradiation. We used propensity score matching to minimize confounding by indication while excluding patients with tumors in the upper lobes to exclude Pancoast tumors. We used 1:1 propensity score matching and Kaplan-Meir survival analyses to estimate associations. Of 4467 patients meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, 210 (4.49%) had an en bloc chest wall resection. Patients undergoing surgical resection were younger (mean age\u00a0=\u00a060.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.3\u00a0years vs 67.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4\u00a0years; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and had more adenocarcinoma (59.0% vs 44.5%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) but were otherwise similar in terms of sex (37.1% female vs 42.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.167) and race (Whites 84.3% vs 84.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.276) compared with the definitive chemoradiation group. After resection, there was an unadjusted 30- and 90-day mortality rate of 3.3% and 9.5%, respectively. A substantial survival benefit with surgical resection persisted after propensity score matching (log-rank P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In this large observational study, we found that in select patients, en bloc chest wall resection for locally advanced clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer was associated with improved survival compared with definitive chemoradiation.

We conducted a nationwide population-based study to evaluate the impact of concurrent AED during post-operative chemo-radiotherapy on outcome. A total of 1057 glioblastoma patients were identified by National Health Insurance Research Database and Cancer Registry in 2008-2015. Eligible criteria included those receiving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and without other cancer diagnoses. Survival between patients taking concurrent AED for 14 days or more during chemo-radiotherapy (AED group) and those who did not (non-AED group) were compared, and subgroup analyses for those with valproic acid (VPA), levetiracetam (LEV), or phenytoin were performed. Multivariate analyses were used to adjust for confounding factors. There were 642 patients in the AED group, whereas 415 in the non-AED group. The demographic data was balanced except trend of more patients in the AED group had previous drug history of AEDs (22.6% vs. 18%, P 0.078). Overall, the AED group had significantly increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.18, P 0.016) compared to the non-AED group. Besides, an adverse dose-dependent relationship on survival was also demonstrated in the AED group (HR = 1.118, P 0.0003). In subgroup analyses, the significant detrimental effect was demonstrated in VPA group (HR = 1.29,P 0.0002), but not in LEV (HR = 1.18, P 0.079) and phenytoin (HR = 0.98, P 0.862). Improved survival was not observed in patients with concurrent AEDs during chemo-radiotherapy. Our real-world data did not support prophylactic use of AEDs for glioblastoma patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute myeloid leukemia is a neoplasm with a high lethality, with alarming results in our country, positioning it as a priority from the point of view of oncological public health. Cytology, immunophenotype, karyogram, and a few translocations/mutations by molecular biology are currently available for diagnosis and stratification. This diagnostic approach is insufficient since it allows classifying less than 50% of patients in a specific group. Therefore, consolidation therapy is selected with little biological information. The role of morphology and cytogenetics is progressively losing prognostic weight with respect to molecular biology, and next-generation sequencing has positioned itself as a key element for diagnosing our patients. In addition, the investigation of germline mutations is acquiring greater relevance, increasing its detection frequency and influencing decision-making regarding treatment and selecting a related donor for an allogeneic transplant. In this review, an update of the integrated diagnosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia is carried out in light of the new diagnostic (WHO 2022 and ICC 2022), and prognostic classifications (ELN 2022). We propose an algorithm for integrated diagnosis to be considered for its implementation. It is imperative as a country to invest in new diagnostic technologies to improve the prognosis of our patients.",

The relapse risk and bone marrow relapse were determined, and the survival rate was measured. The statistical analysis included the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-Rank test. This study included 128 clinical records of patients. Weight had no significant association with relapse risk. The frequency of bone marrow relapse was 43.8%. Obesity did not impact overall survival (p = 0.640) or disease-free survival (p = 0.527). The presence of obesity does not behave as a relapse risk variable (p = 0.873).

The characteristics of CSF are usually analyzed by flow cytometry or cytology. However, paucicellular CSF samples (\u22645 cells/dL) can sometimes be considered unsuitable for analysis due to the low number of events. To evaluate the proportion of samples reported as suitable for analysis obtained by cytometry (FCM) and cytology in paucicellular CSF samples. 169 samples ofpaucicellular CSF corresponding to 115 patients with hematologic neoplasms were selected. The samples were obtained by lumbar puncture in tubes conditioned with EDTA and Transfix\u00ae. We characterized the immunophenotype ofCSF samples with an 8-color panel, and 55 samples (32%) were in a small sample tube (SST). In all cases, monocytes were identified by CD14 labeling and T lymphocytes by CD3 labeling. The acquisition was carried out in a FACSCantoII\u00ae cytometer, and the analysis was performed using Infinicyt\u00ae software. The proportion of samples suitable for analysis was higher in FCM compared to cytology (98% vs 61%, p < 0.000). We identified the presence of T lymphocytes and/or monocytes in most samples (98% and 90%, respectively). In the SST samples, the number of events recorded in low-volume samples (< 1 mL) was lower than in samples with higher volume (140 vs 556, p < 0.001), with a median of identification of 3 cell populations.

        "AbstractText": "In nonmetastatic pelvic liposarcoma patients, it is unknown whether married status is associated with better cancer-control outcome defined as cancer-specific mortality (CSM). We addressed this knowledge gap and hypothesized that married status is associated with lower CSM rates in both male and female patients. Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2000-2020), nonmetastatic pelvic liposarcoma patients were identified. Kaplan-Meier plots and univariable and multivariable Cox regression models (CRMs) predicting CSM according to marital status were used in the overall cohort and in male and female subgroups. Of 1078 liposarcoma patients, 764 (71%) were male and 314 (29%) female. Of 764 male patients, 542 (71%) were married. Conversely, of 314 female patients, 192 (61%) were married. In the overall cohort, 5-year cancer-specific mortality-free survival (CSM-FS) rates were 89% for married versus 83% for unmarried patients (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a06%). In multivariable CRMs, married status did not independently predict lower CSM (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). In males, 5-year CSM-FS rates were 89% for married versus 86% for unmarried patients (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a03%).

Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising treatment for gastric cancer, its toxicity may lead to the loss of skeletal muscle mass. This study investigates the changes in skeletal muscle mass during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its clinical impact on patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. Fifty patients who completed two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery were included. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using computed tomography images before and after chemotherapy. The proportion of skeletal muscle mass change (%SMC) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its cutoff value was explored using the receiver operating characteristic for the overall survival of patients undergoing R0 resection. Risk factors of skeletal muscle mass loss were also evaluated. Overall, 64% of patients had skeletal muscle mass loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (median %SMC -3.4%; range: -18.9% to 10.3%). Multivariable analysis identified older age (\u226570\u00a0years) as an independent predictor of skeletal muscle mass loss (mean [95% confidence interval]: -4.70% [-8.83 to -0.58], p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Among 43 patients undergoing R0 resection, %SMC <-6.9% was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 11.53; 95% confidence interval, 2.78-47.80) and relapse-free survival (hazard ratio 4.54, 95% confidence interval 1.50-13.81).

The risk of malignancy (ROM) for each category has recently been analyzed in three international databases. This paper compares the diagnostic performance of the Bethesda classification in a high-volume referral center in Belgium. All consecutive thyroid procedures were registered in a prospective database from January 2010 till August 2022. Patient and surgical characteristics, preoperative Bethesda categories, and postoperative pathology results were analyzed. Out of 2219 consecutive thyroid procedures, 1226 patients underwent preoperative FNA. Papillary thyroid cancer was the most prevalent malignancy (N\u00a0=\u00a0119, 70.4%), followed by follicular (N\u00a0=\u00a017, 10.1%) and medullary thyroid cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a015, 8.9%). Micropapillary thyroid cancer was incidentally found in 46 (3.8%) patients. Bethesda categories I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively, represented 250 (20.4%; ROM 4.4%), 546 (44.5%; ROM 3.8%), 96 (7.8%; ROM 20.8%), 231 (18.8%; ROM 15.2%), 62 (5.1%; ROM 72.6%), and 41 (3.3%; ROM 90.2%) patients. Overall ROM was 13.8%. An negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.2% was found. Overall specificity was 64.2% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31.9%. Diagnostic accuracy was 67.8%. Compared to international databases (CESQIP, EUROCRINE, and UKRETS), ROM in this study appeared lower for Bethesda category IV (15.2 vs. 26.7% and p\u00a0=\u00a00.612). Despite being validated in numerous studies, ROM based on preoperative FNA cytology classified according to the Bethesda classification may vary among surgical centers and countries as this study reveals a higher NPV and lower PPV.",

This helps optimize comfort for those who cannot be cured or have a lower life expectancy. Few studies have investigated the risk factors for 1-year mortality after gastrectomy for gastric cancer (GC). A total of 1415 patients with gastric cancer (stages I-IV) who underwent gastrectomy between 2005 and 2020 were included. The patients were randomly assigned to the investigation group (n\u00a0=\u00a0850) and validation group (n\u00a0=\u00a0565) in a 3:2 ratio. In the investigation group, significant independent prognostic factors for predicting 1-year survival were identified. A scoring system for predicting 1-year mortality was developed which was validated in the validation group. Multivariate analysis revealed that the following seven variables were significant independent factors for 1-year survival: age \u226778, preoperative comorbidity, total gastrectomy, postoperative complication (Clavien-Dindo classification CD\u00a0\u2267\u00a03a), stage III and IV, and R2 resection.

This has prompted a shift toward same day surgeries and a focus on reducing hospital readmissions. Following the institution of a same day discharge protocol for mastectomy and mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, we sought to assess differences in the length of stay and readmission rates. This retrospective review evaluates all cases of mastectomy with or without immediate reconstruction performed at a single high-volume center between June 2019 and March 2021. Average length of stay, 30-day readmission rates, Anesthesia Society Assessment class, and type of immediate reconstruction were assessed. Autologous reconstructions were excluded.

Swallowing related quality of life (SWAL-QoL) has not been compared between the two approaches. Using a rigorous qualitative methodology and validated reliable tool, this study set out to compare the swallowing related quality of life in patients undergoing TOETVA versus OTx. Prospective study at 3 time points in patients planned for hemithyroidectomy (Preoperative, 1\u00a0week and 12\u00a0weeks). Data were collected on patients at a tertiary teaching institute in India. Participants ranged from age 18-60\u00a0years with a diagnosis of benign euthyroid nodule undergoing hemithyroidectomy. Exclusion criteria were-(1) pre-existing vocal cord abnormalities, (2) undergoing surgery for recurrent nodules, and (3) any neuro-muscular disease affecting swallowing ability. Main outcome measure was comparison of swallowing related quality of life domain scores between patients undergoing hemithyroidectomy via either endoscopic trans-oral or open approach. Of the 82 included patients, 40 underwent TOETVA and 42 OTx. Both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic and clinicopathological profile. The mean preoperative SWAL-QOL scores were comparable in all domains. Mean SWAL-QoL scores for all domains on postoperative day 7 were significantly better in TOETVA group with domains burden, eating desire, mental health and communication having medium effect sizes. Physical symptom domain was better in the OTx group but had a small effect size. The difference in SWAL-QoL domains between the two groups persisted for 3\u00a0months also. Swallowing related quality of life after trans-oral endoscopic thyroidectomy compared to conventional open surgery has not been reported in the literature. Our findings suggest that trans-oral endoscopic thyroidectomy results in significant superior swallowing related quality of life in the majority of domains.",

We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of 91 LAMN perforation patients from 9 teaching hospitals over a 10-year period, and divided them into HIPEC group and non-HIPEC group based on whether or not underwent HIPEC. Of the 91 patients with LAMN, 52 were in the HIPEC group and 39 in the non-HIPEC group. The Kaplan-Meier method predicted that 52 patients in the HIPEC group had 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 82.7% and 76.9%, respectively, compared with predicted survival rates of 51.3% and 46.2% for the 39 patients in the non-HIPEC group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a010.622, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a010.995, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Compared to the 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 75.0% and 65.4% in the HIPEC group, respectively, the 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 48.7% and 46.2% in the non-HIPEC group were significant different between the two outcomes (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a08.063, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005; \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a06.775, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

This study shows that surgery combined with HIPEC can significantly improve 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates and relapse-free survival rates of LAMN perforation patients, without affecting their short-term clinical outcomes.",

Bioactive compounds include retinal and all-trans retinoic acid with important functions in vision, immune function, growth, and development. The literature search that was performed for the current scoping review yielded a total of seven publications relevant to setting the recommended daily intake for vitamin A. In total, six publications assessed the relationship of serum retinol and/or dietary vitamin A intake with fracture risk (n = 2), cancer (n = 3), and deficiency after bariatric surgery (n = 1). One additional report by the European Food Safety Administration (EFSA) with updated average requirements was included. The outcomes-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed positive associations for vitamin A intake and serum retinol with risk of hip fracture. Weak or inconclusive associations were observed for cancer or obesity. One publication by EFSA with updated estimated average requirements and population reference intakes for dietary vitamin A intakes was published in 2015. The EFSA recommendations and estimated average requirements are based on a European reference population, with body weights derived from an assumed body mass index of 22, which might be too low and not representative of the Nordic and Baltic populations, and consequently resulting in lower estimated average requirements and recommendations. In conclusion, there were limited new outcomes-based data for vitamin A and health outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Ewing's sarcoma is highly aggressive bone tumor having predilection for younger age groups with t (11,22) translocation, recombines the FLI-1 and EWS genes on chromosome 22. This disease requires multi-disciplinary treatment withneo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery or radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. This study was aimed to assess the demographic distribution, clinical behaviour and oncological outcome of Ewings Sarcoma involving upper extremity. From 2015 to 2022, 45 patients of upper extremity Ewing's sarcoma underwent treatment at a territory cancer centre. A total of 26 patients treated with surgical management were included in the study comprising 15 males (57.7\u00a0%) and 11 females (42.3\u00a0%). Mean age of presentation was 26 years (3-43 years). The most common site for Ewings sarcoma of upper extremity was Humerus(42\u00a0%) followed by Scapula(27\u00a0%), Radius(15\u00a0%), Ulna(8\u00a0%), Metacarpals(4\u00a0%) and Clavicle(4\u00a0%). Out of 26 cases, 19 (73%) underwent limb salvage surgery and 7 (27%) underwent ampuation surgery. In limb salvage group reconstruction with Extra-corporeal radiotherapy (ECRT), Ulna centralization, Megaprosthesis and 3D printed scapula was performed following wide resection of tumor. In Amputation group ray resection in one case and forequarter amputation was performed in six cases. Mean serum LDH value was 335 IU/L (2.3X Normal value) and serum albumin was 4.04\u00a0gm/dl. Mean tumour necrosis after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was 68\u00a0%. Out of 26 cases, 19(73\u00a0%) cases underwent limb salvage and 7 patients underwent amputation surgery. Out of 26, 13 (50\u00a0%) patients developed metastasis on follow up. The Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 70 % at 12 months and 40 % at 24 months. Mean Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 33.5 months (22.3-44.6) and Median Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 25 months (19.7-30.2). This study characterises demographic and oncologic outcomes of upper extremity ewings sarcoma in Indian subpopulation. Pain and swelling were prominent clinical findings at presentation in patients with upper extremity Ewing's sarcoma. The survival rate following limb salvage surgery in Ewings sarcoma of upper extremity was comparable to that of patients with amputation surgery. Ewings sarcoma of upper extremity was associated with higher LDH level which was raised more than twice the normal range and can led to worse oncologic outcomes. A comparative study on upper extremity and lower extremity ewings sarcoma will be of help to improve literature on this rare disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The prevailing desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressive microenvironment within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pose substantial challenges to therapeutic intervention. Despite the potential of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors in mitigating the desmoplastic stromal response and enhancing the immune milieu, their efficacy is curtailed by suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) and insufficient tumor penetration. To surmount these hurdles, we have pioneered a novel strategy, employing lipid bilayer-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (termed \"silicasomes\") as a carrier for the delivery of Nintedanib. Nintedanib, a triple PTK inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors, was encapsulated in the pores of silicasomes via a remote loading mechanism for weak bases. This innovative approach not only enhanced pharmacokinetics and intratumor drug concentrations but also orchestrated a transformative shift in the desmoplastic and immune landscape in a robust orthotopic KRAS-mediated pancreatic carcinoma (KPC) model. Our results demonstrate attenuation of vascular density and collagen content through encapsulated Nintedanib treatment, concomitant with significant augmentation of the CD8+/FoxP3+ T-cell ratio. This remodeling was notably correlated with tumor regression in the KPC model. Strikingly, the synergy between encapsulated Nintedanib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy further potentiated the antitumor effect. Both free and encapsulated Nintedanib induced a transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1 via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In summary, our pioneering approach involving the silicasome carrier not only improved antitumor angiogenesis but also profoundly reshaped the desmoplastic stromal and immune landscape within PDAC. These insights hold excellent promise for the development of innovative combinatorial strategies in PDAC therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Influenza pandemics are unpredictable recurrent events with global health, economic, and social consequences. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the latest developments in early diagnosis and specific treatment of the disease and its complications, particularly with regard to respiratory organ failure. Despite advances in treatment, the rate of mortality in the intensive care unit remains approximately 30%. Therefore, early identification of potentially severe viral pneumonia is extremely important to optimize treatment in these patients. The pathogenesis of influenza virus infection depends on viral virulence and host response. Thus, in some patients, it is associated with an excessive systemic response mediated by an authentic cytokine storm. This process leads to severe primary pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Initial prognostication in the emergency department based on comorbidities, vital signs, and biomarkers (e.g., procalcitonin, ferritin, human leukocyte antigen-DR, mid-regional proadrenomedullin, and lactate) is important. Identification of these biomarkers on admission may facilitate clinical decision-making to determine early admission to the hospital or the intensive care unit. These decisions are reached considering pathophysiological circumstances that are associated with a poor prognosis (e.g., bacterial co-infection, hyperinflammation, immune paralysis, severe endothelial damage, organ dysfunction, and septic shock). Moreover, early implementation is important to increase treatment efficacy. Based on a limited level of evidence, all current guidelines recommend using oseltamivir in this setting. The possibility of drug resistance should also be considered. Alternative options include other antiviral drugs and combination therapies with monoclonal antibodies. Importantly, it is not recommended to use corticosteroids in the initial treatment of these patients. Furthermore, the implementation of supportive measures for respiratory failure is essential. Current recommendations are limited, heterogeneous, and not regularly updated. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation is the basic treatment for patients with severe respiratory failure. Prone ventilation should be promptly performed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, while early tracheostomy should be considered in case of planned prolonged mechanical ventilation. Clinical trials on antiviral treatment and respiratory support measures specifically for these patients, as well as specific recommendations for different at-risk populations, are necessary to improve outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The complicated nature of tumor formation makes it difficult to identify discriminatory genes. Recently, transcriptome-based supervised classification methods using support vector machines (SVMs) have become popular in this field. However, the inclusion of less significant variables in the construction of classification models can lead to misclassification. To improve model performance, feature selection methods such as enrichment analysis can be used to extract useful variable sets. The detection of genes that can discriminate between normal and tumor samples in the association of cancer and disease remains an area of limited information. We therefore aimed to discover novel and practical sets of discriminatory biomarkers by utilizing the association of cancer and disease. In this study, we employed an SVM classification method for differentially expressed genes enriched by Disease Ontology and filtered nondiscriminatory features using Wilk's lambda criterion prior to classification. Our approach uses the discovery of disease-associated genes as a viable strategy to identify gene sets that discriminate between tumor and normal states. We analyzed the performance of our algorithm using comprehensive RNA-Seq data for adenocarcinoma of the colon, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and adenocarcinoma of the lung. The classification performance of the obtained gene sets was analyzed by comparison with different expression datasets and previous studies using the same datasets. It was found that our algorithm extracts stable small gene sets that provide high accuracy in predicting cancer status. In addition, the gene sets generated by our method perform well in survival analyses, indicating their potential for prognosis. By combining gene sets for both diagnosis and prognosis, our method can improve clinical applications in cancer research. Our algorithm is available as an R package with a graphical user interface in Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.SVMDO) and GitHub (https://github.com/robogeno/SVMDO).",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma is the most heterogeneous and the most difficult-to-treat type of brain tumor and one of the deadliest among all cancers. The high plasticity of glioma cancer stem cells and the resistance they develop against multiple modalities of therapy, along with their high heterogeneity, are the main challenges faced during treatment of glioblastoma. Therefore, a better understanding of the stemness characteristics of glioblastoma cells is needed. With the development of various single-cell technologies and increasing applications of machine learning, indices based on transcriptomic and/or epigenomic data have been developed to quantitatively measure cellular states and stemness. In this study, we aimed to develop a glioma-specific stemness score model using scATAC-seq data for the first time. We first applied three powerful machine-learning algorithms, i.e. random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting, to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data to discover the most important genes associated with cellular states. We then identified promoter and enhancer regions associated with these genes. After downloading the scATAC-seq peaks and their read counts for each patient, we identified the overlapping regions between the single-cell peaks and the peaks of genes obtained through machine-learning algorithms. Then we calculated read counts that were mapped to these overlapping regions. We finally developed a model capable of estimating the stemness score for each glioma cell using overlapping regions and the importance of genes predictive of glioblastoma cellular states. We also created an R package, accessible to all researchers regardless of their coding proficiency. Our results showed that mesenchymal-like stem cells display higher stemness scores compared to neural-progenitor-, oligodendrocyte-progenitor-, and astrocyte-like cells. scATAC-seq can be used to assess heterogeneity in glioblastoma and identify cells with high stemness characteristics.

Typical examples of operating characteristics include the likelihood of detecting treatment effects and the average study duration, which depend on parameters that are unknown until after the onset of the clinical study, such as the distributions of the primary outcomes and patient profiles. Two crucial components of sensitivity analyses are (i) the choice of a set of plausible simulation scenarios and (ii) the list of operating characteristics of interest. We propose a new approach for choosing the set of scenarios to be included in a sensitivity analysis. We maximize a utility criterion that formalizes whether a specific set of sensitivity scenarios is adequate to summarize how the operating characteristics of the trial design vary across plausible values of the unknown parameters. Then, we use optimization techniques to select the best set of simulation scenarios (according to the criteria specified by the investigator) to exemplify the operating characteristics of the trial design.

Despite various therapeutic approaches being used in clinical practice, the overall effectiveness remains insufficient. Stigmasterol, a compound known for its anti-tumor properties and ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, has been found to influenced the composition of the intestinal microbiota. However, the mechanism through which stigmasterol influences the intestinal microbial-host crosstalk in HCC remains elusive. This study was to investigate whether stigmasterol can remodel gut microbiota, and suppress tumor volume by regulating Treg and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ cell in the host with HCC. Stigmasterol (at dosages of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was orally administered to Balb/c mice with subcutaneous tumor once every 2 days for 3 weeks. We first found that tumors volume in the group treated with 100 mg/kg stigmasterol were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05), which exhibited a similar effect as the sorafenib treatment in mice with HCC. This resulted in a significant upregulation of Caspase3, Bax, and P53 expressions, as well as a decrease in Cyclin D1 expression, ultimately leading to a reduction in tumor volume. Additionally, stigmasterol can alter the \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity of the intestinal flora and significantly increase the abundance of Lactobacillus_johnsonii, Lactobacillus_murinus, and Lactobacillus_reuteri (P<0.05), which can lead to a decrease in the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to CD8+ T cells in the intestinal tract and tumor tissue, and consequently enhance immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the host with HCC. In this study, we initially utilized different dosages of stigmasterol to intervene in mice with HCC and confirmed its inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo, and discovered that stigmasterol affected Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, resulting in an increased proportion of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells and Treg cells in both the intestinal mucosa and tumor tissues, and ultimately leading to increased levels of apoptotic proteins and the subsequent death of tumor cells, which shed light on the effect of stigmasterol on host intestinal tissue and intratumoral immune cells by reshaping the intestinal microbiota, and provide a theoretical foundation for the potential clinical application of stigmasterol in the treatment of HCC.",

After resection of the bilateral ovarian cystic tumor, her symptoms improved. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was evaluated using single-photon emission computed tomography. The rCBF was increased in the amygdala, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and anterior temporal lobes, but decreased in the dorsolateral frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and occipital lobes. Findings in this case suggest that altered rCBF in the patient with asystole episodes associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was observed in several brain lesions. The rCBF increases in the central autonomic networks, i.e., the amygdala, hypothalamus, and anterior cingulate, might be associated with dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems leading to asystole.",

A faecal immunochemical test (FIT) result of \u226510\u2009\u00b5g has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection. An FIT-based diagnostic pathway may lead to more effective resource utilisation. We aimed to use National Endoscopy Database (NED) data to create a new colonoscopy performance measure, cancer detection rate (CDR) to assess the appropriate identification of target populations for colonoscopy; then to use CDR to assess the impact of implementing an FIT-based referral pathway locally. NED data were analysed to compare local diagnostic colonoscopic CDR in 2019 (prepathway revision) and 2021 (postpathway revision), benchmarked against overall national CDR for the same time frames. 1, 123, 624 NED diagnostic colonoscopies were analysed. Locally, there was a significant increase in CDR between 2019 and 2021, from 3.01% (2.45%-3.47%) to 4.32% (3.69%-4.95%), p=0.003. The CDR increase was due to both a 10% increase in the number of CRCs detected and a 25% reduction in the number of diagnostic colonoscopies performed. Nationally, there was a smaller, but significant, increase in CDR from 2.02% (1.99%-2.07%) to 2.33% (2.29%-2.37%), p<0.001. The rate of increase in CDR% between 2019 and 2021 was significantly different locally compared with nationally. Our study indicates that the introduction of a robustly vetted FIT-based algorithm to determine whether diagnostic colonoscopy is required, is effective in increasing the colonoscopic CDR. Moreover, CDR appears to be a meaningful performance metric that can be automatically calculated through NED, enabling monitoring of the quality of referral and vetting pathways.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, FIT was used to triage patients referred with urgent 2-week wait (2ww) cancer referrals instead of a direct-to-test strategy. FIT-negative patients were assessed and safety netted in a FIT negative clinic. We reviewed case notes for 622 patients referred on a 2ww pathway and seen in a FIT negative clinic between June 2020 and April 2021 in a tertiary care hospital. We collected information on demographics, indication for referral, dates for referral, clinic visit, investigations and long-term outcomes. The average age of the patients was 71.5 years with 54% female, and a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Indications for referrals included: anaemia (11%), iron deficiency (24%), weight loss (9%), bleeding per rectum (5%) and change in bowel habits (61%). Of the cases, 28% (95% CI 24% to 31%) had endoscopic (15%, 95%\u2009CI 12% to 18%) and/or radiological (20%, 95%\u2009CI 17% to 23%) investigations requested after clinic review, and among those investigated, malignancy rate was 1.7%, with rectosigmoid neuroendocrine tumour, oesophageal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. A FIT negative clinic provides a safety net for patients with unexplained symptoms but low risk of colorectal cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of thoracic segmental SA vs GA during abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures. This study was conducted at our university hospital and involved a total of 46 patients who underwent abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures. The study period spanned from January 15, 2022, to October 15, 2022. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 23) received standard GA, and group 2 (n = 23) received thoracic segmental SA. A combination of 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% and 25 \u03bcg of fentanyl was injected through the spinal needle. The epidural catheter was then threaded through the Tuohy needle after withdrawal of the spinal needle to keep only 4 cm up in the epidural space. Demographic data, both intra and postoperative hemodynamic parameters, were monitored. Postoperatively, pain in both groups was treated with intravenous (IV) morphine by patient controlled analgesia (PCA), PCA settings were 1 mg morphine/mL, no background infusion, bolus dose 2 mL and lockout interval 15 min. Postoperative, both resting VAS and VAS during cough were measured for all patients at fixed intervals, and all patients were followed up for postoperative complications. No significant variation was found in demographic data. Intra and postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) measurements were higher in group 1 than in group 2 but without a statistically significant difference (P < 0.029). Early postoperative VAS values and discharge time from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were significantly reduced in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.001). The number of patients asked for analgesia and total opioid consumption were substantially reduced in group 2 than in group 1. Also, the time of the first analgesia request and patient satisfaction were substantially greater in group 2 than in group 1. Combined thoracic spinal/epidural block results in stable hemodynamics, longer postoperative analgesia with fewer side effects, and greater surgeon and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures.",

A logistic regression model was developed to predict menopausal status based on hub genes. Additionally, gene expression analysis of two important genes was performed by qPCR. The study identified the hub genes and molecular pathways (the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, and lipid metabolic and atherosclerosis pathways) associated with the obesity paradox in BC based on menopausal statutes.

Data of 295 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy at the Department of General Surgery of Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (Xuzhou, China) between March 2016 and November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed as the training group. Additionally, 109 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at the Department of General Surgery Affiliated to Jining First People's Hospital (Jining, China) were included for external validation. Four machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), were utilized. Model performance was assessed by comparing the area under the curve (AUC) for each model. An LR-based nomogram model was constructed to assess patients' clinical prognosis. Lasso regression identified eight associated factors: age, sex, maximum tumor diameter, nerve or vascular invasion, TNM stage, gastrectomy type, lymphocyte count, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. The performance of these models was evaluated using the AUC. In the training group, the AUC values were 0.795, 0.759, 0.873, and 0.853 for LR, DT, RF, and GBM, respectively. In the validation group, the AUC values were 0.734, 0.708, 0.746, and 0.707 for LR, DT, RF, and GBM, respectively.

A literature review was performed to identify the risk factors associated with surgical complications, decreased functional outcomes/quality of life, and pouch failure after IPAA. Based on this, a preliminary checklist was devised and modified through an iterative process. This was then evaluated by a consensus group comprising the pouch multidisciplinary team (MDT) core members. The final preoperative checklist includes assessment for risk factors such as gender, advanced age, obesity, comorbidities, sphincteric impairment, Crohn's disease and pelvic radiation therapy. In addition, essential steps in the decision-making process, such as pouch nurse counselling and discussion regarding surgical alternatives, are also included. The last step of the checklist is discussion at a dedicated pouch-MDT. A preoperative checklist may support clinicians with the selection of patients that are suitable for pouch surgery.

While emerging evidence clearly suggests that changes in epitranscriptomics play a crucial role in cancer pathogenesis, a comprehensive understanding of the writers, erasers, and readers of epitranscriptomic processes, particularly under apoptotic conditions remains lacking. The aim of this study was to uncover the changes in the expression of m6A RNA modifiers under apoptotic conditions across various cancer cell lines. Initially, we quantified the abundance of m6A RNA modifiers in cervical (HeLa and ME180), breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), lung (A549 and H1299), and colon (Caco-2 and HCT116) cancer cell lines using qPCR. Subsequently, we induced apoptosis using cisplatin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) to activate intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively, and assessed apoptosis rates via flow cytometry. Further, we examined the transcript abundance of m6A RNA modifiers under apoptotic conditions in cervical, breast, and lung cancer cell lines using qPCR. Overall, treatment with cisplatin increased the abundance of m6A modifiers, whereas TNF-\u03b1 treatment decreased their expression in cervical, breast, and lung cancer cell lines. Specifically, cisplatin-induced apoptosis, but not TNF-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis, resulted in decreased abundance of METTL14 and FTO transcripts. Additionally, cisplatin treatment drastically reduced the abundance of IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 readers. These results suggest that the differential response of cancer cells to apoptotic inducers may be partially attributed to the expression of m6A RNA modifiers.",

Expression signatures of circLDLR, miR-449b-5p, and CHD1 were examined in GC samples using quantitative PCR. Proliferation ability of MKN-45 cells was assessed via CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP/ADP ratios, and NAD+/NADH ratios in cell supernatants were quantified to evaluate aerobic glycolysis. Subcellular isolation assay, quantitative PCR, immunoblot analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and dual luciferase reporter assay were employed to investigate the relationship between genes. Expression of circLDLR and CHD1 was elevated, while miR-449b-5p expression decreased in GC. Functionally, overexpression of circLDLR enhanced proliferation and aerobic glycolysis and hampered apoptosis of MKN-45 cells. However, upregulation of miR-449b-5p or downregulation of CHD1 reversed these effects. CircLDLR acted as an miRNA spongeand regulated the expression of miR-449b-5p, thereby affecting CHD1 and accelerating GC malignant progression.

This study focuses on Si162, a newly synthesized c-Src inhibitor, to identify reliable biomarkers for predicting Si162 sensitivity and explore associated biological characteristics and pathways in melanoma cells. Primary melanoma cells (M1, M21, M24, M84, M133, M307, and M2025) were obtained from patients diagnosed with melanoma. Si162 cytotoxicity tests were performed using luminescent adenosine triphosphate detection and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using microarray-based gene expression data. Differentially expressed genes between the resistant and sensitive groups were identified using Pearson correlation analysis. Gene coexpression, interactions, and pathways were investigated through clustering, network, and pathway analyses. Biological functions were examined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Molecular pathways associated with different responses to Si162 were identified using gene set enrichment analysis. The gene expressions were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cells revealed significant differences in response to Si162 based on the IC50 values (p < 0.05). A total of 36 differentially expressed genes associated with Si162 susceptibility were identified. Distinct expression patterns between the sensitive and resistant groups were observed in 9 genes (LRBA, MGMT, CAND1, ADD1, SETD2, CNTN6, FGF18, C18orf25, and RPL13).

This work presents DACMVA, a novel framework to conduct data augmentation in a cross-modal dataset by translating between modalities and oversampling imputations of missing data. DACMVA was inspired by previous work on the alignment of latent spaces in Autoencoders. DACMVA is a DL data augmentation pipeline that improves the performance in a downstream prediction task. The unique DACMVA framework leverages a cross-modal loss to improve the imputation quality and employs training strategies to enable regularized latent spaces. Oversampling of augmented data is integrated into the prediction training. It is empirically demonstrated that the new DACMVA framework is effective in the often-neglected scenario of DL training on tabular data with continuous labels. Specifically, DACMVA is applied towards cancer survival prediction on tabular gene expression data where there is a portion of missing data in a given modality. DACMVA significantly (p << 0.001, one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test) outperformed the non-augmented baseline and competing augmentation methods with varying percentages of missing data (4%, 90%, 95% missing). As such, DACMVA provides significant performance improvements, even in very-low-data regimes, over existing state-of-the-art methods, including TDImpute and oversampling alone.",

Our previous studies highlighted the potent anti-cancer properties of the principal compounds found in Garcinia yunnanensis (YTE-17), attributing these effects to the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, knowledge regarding the mechanism and effect of YTE-17 in the prevention of colorectal cancer is limited. In this study, we conducted isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) exposed YTE-17, both in\u00a0vitro and invivo, revealing a significant inhibition of the Wnt family member 5a (Wnt5a)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Subsequently, we elucidated the influence and mechanism of YTE-17 on the tumor microenvironment (TME), specifically focusing on macrophage-mediated T helper 17 (Th17) cell induction in a colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model with Wnt5a deletion. Additionally, we performed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the colonic tissue from the Wnt5a-deleted CAC model to characterize the composition, lineage, and functional status of immune mesenchymal cells during different stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in M2 macrophage polarization and Th17 cell phenotype upon treatment with YTE-17, leading to the restoration of regulatory T (Treg)/Th17 cell balance in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that YTE-17 effectively inhibited the glycolysis of Th17 cells in both direct and indirect co-culture systems with M2 macrophages. Notably, our study shed light on potential mechanisms linking the non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signaling pathway and well-established canonical \u03b2-catenin oncogenic pathway in\u00a0vivo. Specifically, we proposed that Wnt5a/JNK signaling activity in IECs promotes the development of cancer stem cells with \u03b2-catenin activity within the TME, involving macrophages and T cells.

        "AbstractText": "Gut dysbiosis has been strongly correlated with colorectal cancer (CRC) development and the use of probiotics to modulate this imbalance represents a potential and promising therapy to prevent and treat CRC. For this reason, the identification of novel probiotic strains from diverse origins has widely increased in recent years, including traditional fermented foods. In this work we describe a new strain previously isolated from pulque (a traditional Mexican beverage), Levilactobacillus brevis CNCM I-5321, which may represent an interesting probiotic candidate to prevent and treat cancer. Indeed, our results show that CNCM I-5321 displays significant and specific antiproliferative capacities in human intestinal cancer cell lines (HT-29, HTC-116 and Caco-2 cells), but not in normal cells (FH cells). In addition, CNCM I-5321 is able to induce: (1) a pro-inflammatory immune response through stimulation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17 cytokines and (2) apoptosis via activation of caspase 8. On the other hand, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay revealed phenotypic resistance of this strain to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. However, no known transferable determinants were found in the genome of CNCM I-5321, thus this probiotic candidate presents no risk of horizontal transfer to the intestinal bacterial population. Finally, the safety status of CNCM I-5321 was evaluated using an innovative model of chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to assess undesirable and/or toxic effects. Overall, our results support that CNCM I-5321 strain is non-pathogenic and safe for potential use as an anti-cancer candidate in human and animal medicine.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Sex-specificity in Surgical Stages of Lung Cancer in Young Adults.",
        "AbstractText": "Young Patients with lung cancer represent a distinct subset of patients with this neoplasm. Young International studies show increased lung cancer rates in females, while the incidence in males continues to decline. There is evidence to suggest that this trend recurs in younger patients. We studied the effects of gender differences on the incidence of surgical stages of lung cancer in young adults and its mortality rate. This study is a retrospective review (2010-2020) of young adults (aged under 45 years) with surgical-stage of lung cancer. We calculated female-to-male differences in incidence rate ratios, tumor characteristics, surgical management, and survival. Cumulative survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. We examined 46 men and 24 women, under 45 years. Female patients were diagnosed at earlier stages. The proportion of stage IA disease was significantly higher in women than in men (46% versus 13%, respectively) (p=0.03). Women were more likely never smokers (42% versus 83%, p=0.02). A histologic subtype, females were more likely to have typical carcinoid tumors (13.54% versus 10.21% for males) (p>0.05). The largest histological type in men was adenocarcinoma (25.53% versus 4.16%, p>0.05). All the patients were operated. Three men had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one was operated on for cerebral oligometastatic before his chest surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 7 women and 21 men. Despite the small number of postoperative complications in our study (n= 8, 11.2%), the male sex was significant in predicting this complication (p<0.05). The mortality rate was 1.4%. The 5-year overall survival rates were 84% in men and 87% in women. Our study identified sex differences in the incidence and mortality rates for surgical lung cancers in young adults, but the biological and endocrine mechanisms implicated in these disparities have not yet been determined.",

This study evaluated the performance of SCORE/SCORE-OP and SCORE2/SCORE2-OP in the East Asian population by using population-based cohort data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) Health Screening Cohort of Korea. A total of 324,384 NHIS examinees from 2004 to 2005 were divided into 5 age groups: 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years,70-79 years, and more than 80 years. The examinees had their predicted cardiovascular disease risks calculated by using SCORE, SCORE2, SCORE-OP, and SCORE2-OP models. The low-risk model was applied on the basis of the cohort's observed event rates. The observed and predicted cardiovascular risks were compared. A total of 324,384 subjects were included (mean age 51.4 \u00b1 7.3 years; women, 37.9% for the SCORE/SCORE2 group and mean age 73.0 \u00b1 2.8 years; women, 47.5% for the SCORE/SCORE2-OP group). Over a median follow-up of 9 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 15.0% and 28.9% in SCORE/SCORE2 and SCORE/SCORE2-OP groups, respectively. The SCORE/SCORE-OP model underestimated cardiovascular disease risk in young men (aged 40-49 years) and women (aged 40-59 years) and overestimated it in older age groups. In contrast, SCORE2/SCORE2-OP invariably overestimated the risk in all age groups and sexes. SCORE2/SCORE2-OP showed no improvement in Harrell's concordance index (C-index) compared with SCORE/SCORE-OP. Calibration plots favored SCORE2 over SCORE but not SCORE2-OP over SCORE-OP. Both SCORE2/SCORE2-OP and SCORE/SCORE-OP overestimated cardiovascular disease risk with low performance. SCORE2/SCORE2-OP showed slight improvement over older versions, but modifications are necessary for the East Asian population.",

The aims of this review were to examine the current evidence from existing literature on the risk of developing cancer and its course among people with SMI. Equivocal results emerge regarding the risk of developing some kind of cancer among people with SMI, with contrasting data on a possible higher, similar or lower risk in comparison with the general population. In contrast, a series of studies have pointed out that patients with SMI who develop cancer are less likely to receive standard levels of cancer care, both in terms of screening, diagnosis and treatment. Also, the mortality for cancer has been confirmed to be higher than the general population. A global sensitization about these problems is mandatory in an era in which community psychiatry has been developed in all countries and that policies of prevention, treatment, follow up, and palliative care should regard all the segments of the population, including people with SMI, through an interdisciplinary approach.",

        "AbstractText": "Two mangostin compounds, gamma-mangostin and alpha-mangostin, show anticancer properties through the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, including MDA-MB-231, highly express C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) to maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell migration. This study was performed to analyze and compare different modes of action of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin as antimigratory effects targeted on CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 as a model of TNBC cell. This study investigated the effect of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin using a series of assays, including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay for cytotoxicity, wound healing assay for migration study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for gene expression analysis, and flow cytometry for ROS measurement, along with in silico study to observe the binding between the compound and CXCR4. The findings revealed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 25 and 20 \u03bcM for \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin in MDA-MB 231 cells, respectively. Moreover, a concentration of 10 \u03bcM was used for the migration assay. Both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin significantly suppressed cell migration within 24 hours. The present gene expression studies revealed the downregulation of key migration-associated genes, namely Farp, CXCR4, and LPHN2, upon \u03b3-mangostin treatment but not \u03b1-mangostin. Additionally, both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin increased cellular ROS generation, highlighting the same effect of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin ROS elevation to inhibit cancer cell migration. Molecular docking simulations further suggested a potential interaction between \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin with CXCR4 in high affinity. These findings suggest that both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin inhibit breast cancer cell migration and induce cellular ROS levels in MDA-MB-231 cells; notably, \u03b3-mangostin suppresses CXCR4 mRNA expression that might correlate to its activity to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell migration.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer immunotherapy targeting adaptive immune cells has been attracting considerable interest due to its great success in treating multiple cancers. Recently, there is also increasing interest in agents that can stimulate innate immune cell activities. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting innate immune cells can block inhibitory interactions ('don't eat me' signals) between tumor cells and phagocytes. CD47 is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in various cancers and acts as a potent 'do not eat me' signal that contributes to the immune evasion of cancer cells. Anti-CD47 peptides that can bind to CD47 and block CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction were discovered using a novel phage display biopanning strategy. Anti-CD47 peptides enhanced the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of NCI-H82 tumor cells in vitro. Unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, these peptides do not induce the agglutination of RBCs. Moreover, anti-CD47 peptides exhibit high specificity for MC-38 cancer cells expressing CD47. CMP-22 peptide showed the ability to increase the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and extends the survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice. The discovered anti-CD47 peptides can be considered potential candidates for cancer immunotherapy by blocking the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction, especially in combination with chemotherapy, to elicit synergistic effects.",

        "AbstractText": "Improvements in pulmonary diagnostic imaging and the development of lung cancer screening are increasing the prevalence of Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). Fluoroscopically guided radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial forceps biopsy (TB-FB) has been the conventional diagnostic method. Transbronchial cryobiopsy (TB-CB) is an alternative biopsy method. We sought to compare transbronchial cryobiopsy to transbronchial forceps biopsy for the diagnosis of SPNs. A prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). Patients with SPNs were randomised to either 5 transbronchial forceps biopsies or one transbronchial cryobiopsy. Complete blinding of investigators and participants was not possible, as transbronchial cryobiopsy required general anaesthesia. The primary outcome was diagnostic yield with secondary outcomes of specimen size, diagnostic yield for subsets challenging to access with forceps and safety. The overall diagnostic yield for the 28 enrolled subjects was 76.8%(22/28). The diagnostic yield was 91.7% (11/12 patients) for transbronchial cryobiopsy and 68.8% (11/16 patients) for forceps biopsy (p=0.14). Median biopsy sizes were consistently larger for the cryobiopsy arm at 7.0mm compared to 2.5mm(p<0.0001). An eccentric EBUS image signalling the probe was adjacent to the nodule occurred in 4/28 cases, and TB-CB confirmed a diagnosis in 3/3 randomised to this arm. There were no major complications with either technique. Transbronchial cryobiopsy under the guidance of fluoroscopy and radial EBUS facilitates larger biopsy specimens without a significant increase in major complications. Further research is required to confirm the effect on diagnostic yield; however, our study supports a role for TB-CB in the diagnosis of SPNs and small, nodule-adjacent biopsies.

The main aim of this study was to compare the percentage of non-diagnostic results between the long and short axis approach. A prospective study that included a randomized controlled trial and was divided into two arms-the short axis and the long axis-was conducted. A total of 245 thyroid nodules were collected through the fine needle aspiration cytology, performed with ultrasound, from march 2021 to march 2022. The patient's demographic information were collected and also nodules characteristics. Of 245 nodules sampled, 122 were sampled with the long axis method, while 123 with the short axis method. There is not significantly less non diagnostic approach with either method compared to the other (11.5\u00a0% vs 16.3\u00a0% respectively). Previous studies came to the conclusion that the long axis method yields fewer non diagnostic samples.

        "ArticleTitle": "Skin Changes in Suspected Lyme Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Dear Editor, Ticks carry many diseases, bacteria, and viruses and represent a very important healthcare issue both in Croatia and globally. Although most ticks are not infected with pathogens dangerous to humans, some ticks can transmit infectious diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. This is caused by the increasing incidence of many tick-borne diseases over a growing geographical area. Many factors influence which species of ticks are present in a given geographical area, as well as the density of their population and the risk of human exposure to infected ticks. The average morbidity from Lyme borreliosis in the Republic of Croatia is 6.51 infected per 100,000 inhabitants. There can be no Lyme borreliosis without ticks infected by Borrelia burgdorferi (1,2). In Europe, Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex genotype. There are three skin manifestations of LB: erythema migrans (EM), borrelial lymphocytoma (BL), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) (3,4). Herein we describe a female patient with a diagnosis of Lyme disease based on the non-specific clinical picture and laboratory diagnostics, in whom successful treatment led to complete regression of all skin manifestations. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with no previous history of severe illness. Notably, the patient history showed that, eight months prior to presenting for the dermatological exam, the patient had observed the appearance of edema and demarcated macular exanthema around both ankles and subsequently on the dorsum of the right hand, which spread to the left hand and with gradual spread to both lower legs and the lower extremities, with more pronounced changes on the left leg. The initial dermatological examination found pronounced skin changes on both legs, especially the left leg, with erythematous changes in the form of figurate erythema forming confluences up to the size of a smaller palm; the skin of the left leg was partially mottled with normal turgor and elasticity (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). Inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged and painless on palpation. Changes were minimal and discrete on the right leg and were absent on the torso, upper extremities, and skin. Subjectively, there was no itching, burning, or tingling sensation in the affected areas of the skin. The patient subjectively reported feeling well. Family history showed that the patient's father had died from prostate cancer and that the mother had died from melanoma. Laboratory findings were as follows: hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters were normal. Venous and arterial ultrasound of both legs was normal, with the presence of reactively enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes. Lyme disease was suspected based on the clinical picture, with a differential diagnosis of possible livedo reticularis. A biopsy of the skin changes was also performed, with the results showing that the histological picture in the examined material could be compatible with the provisional clinical diagnosis of livedo reticularis. IgM and IgG specific for Borrelia burgdorferi was also performed: IgG was borderline, whereas IgM was positive at 218 U/mL. Over the next 3 weeks, Amoxil 500 mg thrice daily was introduced to the treatment. After completion of the treatment, there was a gradual regression of all skin changes without the appearance of new lesions (Figure 2a and Figure 2b) (Figure 3a and Figure 3b). Patient follow-up over the next year did not find any recurrence of similar skin changes. Herein we have described the case of a patient with atypical skin changes in which the presence of antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi was demonstrated, in which regression of all skin manifestations was achieved after diagnosis and adequate antibiotic treatment. Lyme disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that can generally be observed in three stages: the early localized stage, the early disseminated stage, and the late stage of the disease. However, it is also possible for the different stages to overlap and even for the late stage to manifest without any signs and symptoms of the earlier stages. Early localized stage. Characterized by skin changes - erythema migrans (EM) - usually manifests within a month of the tick bite (usually 7-14 days after the bite) (Figure 4 and Figure 5). EM manifests in approximately 80% of patients, but only 25% of patients can recall the tick bite. The skin changes are usually localized in the axilla, the groin, the cubital area, or around the waist. The changes are generally not painful, but can itch or be warm to the touch. They gradually spread over days or weeks and can grow to a radius of up to 20 cm. Initially, the coloration can be uniform for several days, after which the redness disappears around a central zone (4-6). Multiple skin changes are a sign of spirochetemia and not the result of multiple tick bites. Due to timely antimicrobial treatment, multiple skin changes are much rarer today. In the initial days or weeks after infection, patients with early, localized, or disseminated Lyme disease often present with non-specific signs and symptoms resembling a viral infection: fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain, and regional lymphadenopathy. Fever can be present in approximately 20% of patients. Laboratory findings in this phase are non-specific. Erythrocyte sedimentation can be slightly increased, leukocyte counts are mostly normal, and anemia and thrombocytopenia are present only rarely (7,8). Early disseminated stage. This stage is marked by numerous EM lesions (that generally appear days or weeks after the infection) and/or neurological and/or cardiac manifestations (occurring weeks or months after infection). Some of these patients have no data on the presence of early localized Lyme disease. The most common triad of neurological manifestations are meningitis, neuropathy (usually of the facial nerve) and motor or sensory radiculopathy (Bannwarth syndrome). All these manifestations can appear individually. Cranial nerve neuropathies can often be bilateral. Late-stage Lyme disease. Characterized by intermittent or permanent arthritis in one joint or several large joints, most commonly the knees, and/or more rarely by neurological symptoms such as discrete encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late-stage Lyme disease can develop several years after primary infection, and arthritis can be the first manifestation of the disease, with the early localized and early disseminated stages not manifesting at all. In Europe, patients with late-stage Lyme disease can present with chronic skin changes (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), which is not observed in the USA. It is caused by B. afzelii and is typically localized to the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet. It is most common in women >40 years of age but can also present in younger populations. However, due to early antimicrobial treatment of the earlier stages of the disease, late-stage manifestations are rare (9). The discovery of the etiology of this disease showed that some well-known clinical entities were also a manifestation of Borrelia infection. The etiology of other dermatologic diseases was thus determined, such as lymphocytoma (or lymphadenosis cutis benigna), which was recognized as an entity as early as 1884, as well as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, described in 1888, erythema chronicum migrans (Afzelius-Lipsch\u00fctz), and the neurological disease called Bannwarth syndrome, the symptoms of which were described as early as 1922 (10,11). LB and all its dermatological manifestations occur in almost all European countries, predominantly in the central part of the continent. The annual incidence is between 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in France to 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in northeastern Poland, 130 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Austria, and 155 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Slovenia (12). The total prevalence of ACA in all European patients with LB is 1-10%, depending on the region. For example, BL and ACA comprise 0.3% of LB cases in Bulgaria. In Norway, ACA comprises 5% of all clinical LB cases, and in northern Italy that number is 2.5%. Establishing a diagnosis of ACA is much more difficult than diagnosing EM or benign lymphocytoma (BL) because the clinical manifestations of ACA can vary. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is probably the most common late and chronic manifestation of LB that can be observed in European patients. The skin changes in our patient were fairly non-specific, based on descriptions from the literature, but positivity for IgM antibodies was important for establishing the diagnosis, along with the very good response to antibiotics regarding regression of skin changes as well as the histological analysis that, according to the pathohistological diagnosis, indicated livedo reticularis, which is in turn also described in the literature as a possible form of ACA depending on the stage of the disease. Skin changes on the lower extremities are often incorrectly interpreted as vascular insufficiency, e.g. chronic venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, hypostatic eczema, obliterative arterial disease, acrocyanosis, livedo reticularis, or lymphoedema, but they can also be the result of ACA, as in our case (13-15). In cases such as the one we have described, clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can very often vary and differ greatly from the typical clinical picture. This is demonstrated by our case, which also shows that LB and its idiosyncratic manifestations can lead physicians astray in a condition where failing to establish a timely diagnosis can be fatal for the patient. This case report also serves as a reminder that Lyme disease should be considered whenever atypical skin changes are encountered. Given that ACA is a disease in the late stage of Lyme disease and that the changes in our patient were noticed at the very beginning, the disease did not develop to the later stage.",

        "AbstractText": "Mycosis fugnoides (MF) is an indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTLC) and is the most common of all cutaneous lymphomas. An increased risk for developing a second primary malignancy in patients with CTCL has been described in several studies, with a range from 1.04 to 2.4 (1-4). Caucasian males are at higher risk for MF development. MF is often diagnosed at ages between 55 and 67 years, and second malignancy usually occurs 5 or 6 years after the diagnosis of MF was established (5). The most common second primary malignancies include non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and melanoma. Even though a higher incidence rate of all NHL was described in patients with MF (15/1000) in comparison with the general population (0.32/1000), there are still only a few cases of B-cell NHL following MF described in the literature (6,7). We describe a rare case of a patient with MF and simultaneous large cell transformation (LCT) and a small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In 2017, an 82-year-old man previously treated for MF presented with two fast growing tumorous lesions with ulceration on the right tight (Figure 1). A biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of MF with LCT was established (Figure 2). During hospitalization, mild leukocytosis (12.2 x109 L-1), lymphocytosis (64%, total count of 7.81 x109 L-1), and anemia were found. Bone marrow biopsy was not performed due to low pain threshold. Bone marrow aspirate showed 70% of atypical lymphocytes and few \"smudged\" cells. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry detected 49% monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with phenotypic features typical for B-CLL (CD5+, CD23+, kappa +). Of overall bone marrow cells, the ratio of monoclonal kappa + B-cells with the B-CLL phenotype was 21%. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood showed up to 50% monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with phenotypic features typical for B-CLL (CD5+, CD23+, kappa +). Of overall peripheral blood cells, the ratio of monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with the B-CLL phenotype was 28%. Multi-sliced computed tomography was within normal ranges. A flow cytometry showed lymphocytes with phenotypic findings for CD20+ B-CLL. A diagnosis of MF with LCT (CD30+) clinical grade IIB (T3, N0, M0) and B-CLL was established. The patient was treated with fractionated superficial irradiation that resulted in applanation and regression of the tumorous lesions. No hematologic treatment was indicated other than regular follow-up. On dermatologic follow up for 2 years, the patient was stable, with no active skin lesions and no progression of MF. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. This is a rare case of MF with LCT and B-CLL occurring simultaneously. Large cell transformation in patients with MF can occur in 20-55% of advanced MF, as in our case, and this something physicians must be aware of, so repeated biopsies are advised (8). We also should keep in mind that patients with MF are at higher risk of developing a second malignancy. Of those second malignancies, a coexistence of lymphoproliferative disorders in two lineages, T-cell and B-cell, such as CTCL and B-CLL, is very uncommon, and only a few cases have been published (6,7,10). In most of these cases, CTCL preceded B-CLL, and with the only established explanation being increased risk of second malignancy in patients with CTCL (3,5,10). Other explanatory hypotheses include neoplastic stem cells, a genetic predisposition to malignancy, the use of immunosuppressive agents for the treatment for a first neoplasm, viral agents, and modulation of the B-cell system by monoclonal T-cell proliferation (1,5,6,9,10). Regular follow-up is mandatory for all patients with CTCL as well as MF, in order to identify the disease progression but for the timely detection of second malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "While basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in humans, its subepidermal presentation is extremely rare. The risk factors for basal cell carcinoma development are well-known, but it remains unclear in which setting the tumor restricts itself to the dermal compartment. We present the fifth known case of subepidermal basal cell carcinoma. However, this particular presentation is unique due to arising beneath a capillary malformation. The patient had previously undergone multiple laser treatments which yielded no success. Initially, the vascular malformation was removed and sent for histopathological diagnosis. After the discovery of basal cell carcinoma, wide surgical resection was performed. The patient had no recurrence up to the last follow-up at 18 months postoperatively. This case demonstrates a new presentation of a very rare condition, but also highlights the importance of histopathological examination and the need for future research on any possible association between laser therapy and carcinogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Multifocal infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are focal cutaneous lesions affecting more than 1 anatomic site. The multifocal distribution pattern is the rarest form of IH manifestation, accounting for only 3-4% of all affected infants. This type of cutaneous IHs may be a marker for extracutaneous disease, with the liver being the most frequently affected organ. We investigated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a small case series of infants with multifocal IHs presenting with different clinical patterns, all diagnosed and treated in a regional tertiary-care pediatric clinic. Four infants with multifocal IHs were included in the analysis. There were 3 girls and 1 boy. Three out of 4 infants were prematurely born (2 of them very preterm), while only 1 was full-term. Clinical patterns in all cases were quite different, but more than 20 cutaneous IHs were present in each of the patients. Two infants had multifocal liver hemangioma, but without complications. In 3 out of 4 patients, systemic propranolol therapy was introduced, with excellent response in two cases (both with liver involvement). With the increase in the number of cutaneous IHs, the probability of internal organ involvement, most often the liver, also increases. Evaluation for extracutaneous lesions is indicated in infants with 5 or more cutaneous IHs. Treatment of infants with multifocal IHs should be individualized and consider all relevant risk factors, including prematurity.",

Few studies have examined the characteristic dermoscopic features of SH, but a more detailed large-scale study is needed to overcome the diagnostic challenge of differentiating it from acral melanoma. To describe the dermoscopic features of SH. We evaluated the clinical and dermoscopic features of 50 SH lesions from 43 patients at the Pusan National University Hospitals (Busan and Yangsan). In the color analysis, 86% of cases showed the bruise color sign; 7 cases had a single color (red to purple: 2; black: 1; brown: 4). Typical dermoscopic features of SH, acral nevi, and acral melanoma-associated patterns were observed in 60%, 0%, and 72% of lesions, respectively. Hematoma-associated patterns were homogenously red-to-black with or without satellite globules (32%) and pebbles on the ridges (28%). Acral melanoma-associated patterns showed a parallel ridge pattern (PRP) (52%), irregular dots and globules (50%), polychromia (34%), asymmetry (24%), irregular blotches (10%), and ulcers (10%). No case showed blue-white veils, regression structures, atypical vascular patterns, or irregular fibrillar patterns. The bruise color sign was positive in most cases, with acral melanoma-associated patterns (88.9%).",

We evaluated the prevalence, epidemiology, and therapy of CTCLs, focusing on its most well-known subtypes, namely mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS). We retrospectively analyzed the medical data of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of CTCL presenting to our outpatient department during a 5-year period from January 2015 to December 2019. We evaluated the files of 102 patients, of whom 67% were men and 33% women. The overall mean age was 59.1\u00b114.1 (24-86) years. Ninety-two patients (90%) were diagnosed with MF and ten patients (10%) with SS. According to ISCL/EORTC, the majority of patients initially classified as stage IA (34%) and IB (45%). Disease frequency decreased at advanced stages (II: 4%; III: 7%; IV: 10%). Forty-five patients (44.1%) received only skin-directed therapy (SDT). Twenty patients (19.6%) progressed from SDT to systemic therapy (ST). Thirty-seven patients (36.3%) received ST combined with SDT (TS) from the start of treatment. Overall, fifty different therapeutic approaches of TS were initiated due to lack of response to therapy or disease progression. Management of CTCLs aims to maintain patient quality of life while minimizing side-effects. As CTCLs are usually incurable diseases, the focus of treatment is on symptom control and prevention of disease progression. Due to the large patient group and the long observation period, our study allows for a valid evaluation of the frequency and therapy of MF and SS in a university outpatient clinic in Germany. We favor topical therapies in early stages with more invasive therapies in advanced stages.",

The aim of this report is to assess the proportion of histologically abnormal appendices in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection in a unit where standard of care is appendectomy, with consent, when left-sided resection is performed. A retrospective study on a prospectively collected database was conducted in a single tertiary-care center. Overall, 717 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection between January 2015 and June 2021 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the proportion of histologically abnormal appendix specimens at prophylactic appendectomy. The secondary outcome was complications from prophylactic appendectomy. Overall, 576/717 (80%) patients had appendectomy at colorectal cancer surgery. In total, 234/576 (41%) had a right-/extended-right hemicolectomy or subtotal colectomy which incorporates appendectomy, and 342/576 (59%) had left-sided resection (left-hemicolectomy, anterior resection or abdominoperineal excision) with prophylactic appendectomy. At definitive histology, 534/576 (92.7%) had a normal appendix. The remaining 42/576 (7.3%) showed abnormal findings, including: 14/576 (2.4%) inflammatory appendix pathology, 2/576 (0.3%) endometriosis, 8/576 (1.4%) hyperplastic polyp, and 18/576 (3.1%) appendix tumors, which encompassed six low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs), three carcinoids, and nine serrated polyps. In the 342 patients who had prophylactic appendectomy, 10 (2.9%) had a neoplasm (two LAMN, three carcinoids, and five serrated polyps). There were no complications attributable to appendectomy. Occult appendix pathology in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection is uncommon when prophylactic appendectomy was performed.

        "AbstractText": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are sentinels of healthy organ function, yet it is unknown how ILCs adapt to distinct anatomical niches within tissues. Here, we used a unique humanized mouse model, MISTRG mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), to define the gene signatures of human ILCs in the vascular versus the tissue (extravascular) compartment of the lung. Single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with intravascular cell labeling demonstrated that heterogeneous populations of human ILCs and natural killer (NK) cells occupied the vascular and tissue niches in the lung of HSPC-engrafted MISTRG mice. Moreover, we discovered that niche-specific cues shape the molecular programs of human ILCs in the distinct sub-anatomical compartments of the lung. Specifically, extravasation of ILCs into the lung tissue was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in the acquisition of tissue residency, cell positioning within the lung, sensing of tissue-derived signals, cellular stress responses, nutrient uptake, and interaction with other tissue-resident immune cells. We also defined a core tissue signature shared between human ILCs and NK cells in the extravascular space of the lung, consistent with imprinting by signals from the local microenvironment. The molecular characterization of human ILCs and NK cells in the vascular and tissue niches of the lung provides new knowledge on the mechanisms of ILC tissue adaptation and represents a resource for further studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Fermentation is thought to be born in the Fertile Crescent, and since then, almost every culture has integrated fermented foods into their dietary habits. Originally used to preserve foods, fermentation is now applied to improve their physicochemical, sensory, nutritional, and safety attributes. Fermented dairy, alcoholic beverages like wine and beer, fermented vegetables, fruits, and meats are all highly valuable due to their increased storage stability, reduced risk of food poisoning, and enhanced flavor. Over the years, scientific research has associated the consumption of fermented products with improved health status. The fermentation process helps to break down compounds into more easily digestible forms. It also helps to reduce the amount of toxins and pathogens in food. Additionally, fermented foods contain probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that help the body to digest food and absorb nutrients. In today's world, non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and allergies have increased. In this regard, scientific investigations have demonstrated that shifting to a diet that contains fermented foods can reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. Moreover, in the last decade, there has been a growing interest in fermentation technology to valorize food waste into valuable by-products. Fermentation of various food wastes has resulted in the successful production of valuable by-products, including enzymes, pigments, and biofuels.",

        "AbstractText": "\u03b2-Elemene, an active ingredient found in medicinal plants like turmeric and zedoary, is a sesquiterpene compound with antitumor activity against various cancers. However, its current mode of production through plant extraction suffers from low efficiency and limited natural resources. Recently, there has been an increased interest in establishing microbial cell factories to produce germacrene A, which can be converted to \u03b2-elemene by a one-step reaction in vitro. In this study, we constructed an engineered Pichia pastoris cell factory for producing germacrene A. We rerouted the fluxes towards germacrene A biosynthesis through the optimization of the linker sequences between germacrene A synthase (GAS) and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (ERG20), overexpression of important pathway genes (i.e., IDI1, tHMG1, and ACS), and multi-copy integration of related expression cassettes. In combination with medium optimization and bioprocess engineering, the final titer of germacrene A in a 1\u00a0L fermenter reached 1.9\u00a0g/L through fed-batch fermentation. This represents the first report on the production of germacrene A in P. pastoris and demonstrates its advantage in producing terpenoids and other value-added natural products.",

The subcritical water extracts obtained from two varieties, Native and Pawnee, were analyzed for their phenolic contents and compositions. Effects of the extracts on viability and IC50 of the human cell lines representing a broad range of cancer types, cervical, lung, skin, breast, colon and prostate cancers, were investigated. Although the effect of the temperature on the phenolic contents and compositions of the extracts was not statistically significant, the influence of the variety was extensive. The pecan shell extracts were not cytotoxic to the healthy cell line Vero in the concentration range examined. Some of the pecan shell extracts had greater efficay than Doxorubicin, a drug used in cancer chemotherapy, in reducing cancer cell viability. This study is novel and practical implications of the data generated in this study are noteworthy, because this is the first report on the beneficial effects of subcritical water extracts obtained from pecan shelling industry byproducts on a broad range of cancer cell lines. It is likely that the experimental data presented in this study will support and encourage future research on the biological pathways involved in the interactions of the cancer cells and the extracts. The findings of this study will facilitate research on downstream processing and purification of the crude extracts exhibiting high cancer cell cytotoxcity, potentially improving the final product efficacy and lead to commercial applications.",

        "AbstractText": "Successful engineering of functional salivary glands necessitates the creation of cell-instructive environments for ex vivo expansion and lineage specification of primary human salivary gland stem cells (hS/PCs). Herein, basement membrane mimetic hydrogels were prepared using hyaluronic acid, cell adhesive peptides, and hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG), with or without sulfate groups, to produce \"hyperGel+\" or \"hyperGel\", respectively. Differential scanning fluorescence experiments confirmed the ability of the sulphated HPG precursor to stabilize fibroblast growth factor 10. The hydrogels were nanoporous, cytocompatibile and cell-permissive, enabling the development of multicellular hS/PC spheroids in 14 days. Incorporation of sulfated HPG species in the hydrogel enhanced cell proliferation. Culture of hS/PCs in hyperGel+ in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (Y-27), led to the development of spheroids with a central lumen, increased the expression of acinar marker aquaporin-3 at the transcript level (AQP3), and decreased the expression of ductal marker keratin 7 at both the transcript (KRT7) and the protein levels (K7). Reduced expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) targets SMAD2/3 was also observed in Y27-treated cultures, suggesting attenuation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Thus, hyperGel+ cooperates with the ROCK inhibitor to promote the development of lumened spheroids with enhanced expression of acinar markers.",

PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) has been studied in the various neoplasms as proposed as diagnostic and therapeutic markers. PRAME is expressed in normal sebaceous units and in some sebaceous lesions; however, its utility in sebaceous carcinoma diagnosis has not yet been extensively investigated. We conducted a 13-year retrospective review of the patients diagnosed with PSC at the National Specialist Ophthalmic Pathology Service in Liverpool. Herein, we report the histomorphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) features of these tumors, particularly PRAME expression in this cohort. Thirty-one PSC cases diagnosed between 2009 and 2022 were retrieved from the histopathology archives. Twenty cases diagnosed as invasive PSC and 11 cases with in situ PSC were included. The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides and previously performed IHC slides were reviewed; clinical information data were obtained. Cases with an adequate tissue were also stained for PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) and adipophilin (if not already performed). In total, there were 24 females and 7 males diagnosed with PSC, ranging from 55 to 90 years (median, 78 years). The types of specimens received were 11 conjunctival mapping biopsies, 19 excisions/wedge resections, and 1 orbital exenteration. The eyelid was the commonest site involved (n = 24), followed by eyelid with conjunctiva (3), and conjunctiva alone (4). All patients presented with the clinical suspicion of malignancy. Histologically, 11 invasive PSC (55%) exhibited poorly differentiated morphology, composed of predominantly atypical basaloid cells with minimal sebocytic differentiation; 9 cases (45%) were moderately differentiated with noticeable finely multivacuolated cytoplasm; and 3 (15%) showed associated comedo necrosis. Most invasive PSC showed moderate-to-brisk mitotic activities. Of those cases with available immunostains (n = 31), 25 (80.6%) expressed adipophilin; 18 (58.1%) Ber-EP4; 14 (45.2%) epithelial membrane antigen (EMA); and 5 (16.1%) both androgen receptor and perforin positivity. PRAME expression was seen in normal sebaceous glands; however, only (5/19; 26%) of invasive PSC showed focal weak-to-moderate PRAME positivity, and mostly in moderately differentiated tumors. None of the in situ PSCs were PRAME-positive. Most PSCs are moderate-to-poorly differentiated. Although PRAME is expressed in normal sebaceous units, it appears less useful as diagnostic marker for PSC, especially in poorly differentiated tumors. In difficult cases, panels of IHC studies (adipophilin, Ber-EP4, and EMA) achieve a definitive diagnosis.",
